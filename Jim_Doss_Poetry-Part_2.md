## Cancer


In your delirium you spoke,  
the morphine drip supplying the muse.  

*Crows are standing in a field of white mud,  
leaving hieroglyphs for the clouds to read.  
No, they are standing above the mud,  
they are flying without their wings.  
They are fighting over the body  
of some kind of animal   
flattened by a tire, smashed by something   
it couldn’t see coming, it’s sacrifice 
enough to keep the murder going.*   

As you talked I bathed your grey body   
with a sponge afraid your skin might come off   
at my touch, felt the cold of your limbs against   
the warmth my hand absorbed from the soapy water.    
I washed around the ports in your abdomen   
that drained the infections, the port in your chest  
that took in the drugs that no longer worked,  
felt the lumps like those small hills in Greece  
where we spent our honeymoon overlooking the Aegean.  

*Yes it was blue, crystalline blue   
like the topaz of your eyes,   
the ring I gave you after our first child,   
the coldness that overtakes me.  
I am nothing now, nothing   
but a thin vessel of air,  
a soul with barely a body.  When I drift off   
into the wind toward that other place,   
when I am no longer with you  
I will send a message, an unexpected  
message of love.  You’ll keep wondering  
is that my sign everywhere you look--  
the green eyes of a cat, the hummingbird stilled  
in mid-flight, the unknown boy who asks for a hug--  
is that my sign as year after year goes by.*  

*Hurry, the crows are hungry.*

## A Family Visit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Mick Jagger & Keith Richards


He only felt safe behind the locks and security windows.  
We could see him visibly relax as he entered the room  
though there was some seventy year old hippie  
in pigtails chanting some Buddhist hymn,   
slowly turning circles lost in his otherworldliness.  
Just as we start talking, a Hispanic girl scooted in beside us   
to tell us she was really a Romanov princess and the KGB  
is trying to track her down, offered to teach us Russian,  
started talking gibberish as the orderlies apologized   
and move her back to her room.  Then the lady  
roaming the halls with two black eyes,  
dressed in a hospital gown, no underwear,   
began beating her head against the glass,  
rattling the walls, screaming like a wild animal   
as the starfish on her forehead grew and grew.  
The man grinning across from us, who looked like a ‘50s   
rock and roller dressed in grey sweatpants and penny loafers   
started stroking himself, slow at first, then faster.  
“What are you doing here, you’re not like these people.”  
He blinked, swallowed his pills, obediently did as instructed  
to keep the voices away, those notes we found scattered  
around his house:  “Shhh!  Be very quiet, don’t move,  
the people from the red planet are here. They’ll rip   
your heart out and eat it if you look at them wrong.”

## Giving Thanks

Often late at night when the moon hangs  
like a hive in the highest tree,  
I take down the box of sharpest Crayolas  
and begin to shape a life on a clear sheet of paper.  

The outline of a window emerges,  
divided like a heart into four chambers.  

In one I draw a man sitting at his desk,  
his eyes swirling with the dust of the Milky Way,  
his fingers resting against his temple  
in the shape of a peace sign,  
a hummingbird tattooed on his neck  
sipping from the carafe of a honeysuckle flower.  
I call this *serenity.*  

In another I sketch  
a woman standing by a stove  
in a sky-blue dress with clouds passing through.  
In her hands a dove rests  
soft as pillow to lay her head on,  
its breast stained red with the eye of eternity.  
Steam rises from a pot of boiling potatoes.  
Its weeping coats the panes,  
reveals those words of loneliness written there  
with the invisible ink of fingers.  
I call this *survival.*  

In the third  
I trace a hand reaching  
for the blushing green skin of an apple  
grazed by the wind’s teeth  
as it clings to a leafy branch.  
But just as the hand starts to close around the fruit,  
another reaches out to guide it  
toward a face where callus touches softness.  
I call this love.  
On a good day I might call it *singing.*  

Lastly, I etch  
the stick-figures of children,  
sexless, all dressed the same  
as they hold hands smiling in the sunshine.  
Grapes ripen on the vines around them,  
little worlds exploding with each mouthful,  
as the daisy chain of kids stretches ever smaller  
toward the horizon like a wish only half conceived.  
I call this *eternity.*  

Then I color the window frame  
with winter weather, mist rolling in  
from the meadow, the cracked skin of a birch.  

At this hour  
the house grows quiet as a river  
winged by hands that flutter out to hush the sleeping,  
and my name barely remains my name,  
my death hardly a nest to lay in  
with its comfort of subtraction as the days tick down.  

Lord, I ask very little,  
but grant me a table to sit at,  
hands to fold in prayer  
and the strength to say *Amen, Amen, Amen*  
through nights blacker than any color the eye can see.

## Walking Stones

i was born in the spring in 1958 in a country clearly my own  
i was born embracing my father’s drawl his curly hair   
the agate of his eye before my own eyes had barely opened   
my mother’s suffering erected an orphanage around me  
this mirror of her own childhood filled with farm chores  
pickup trucks beans in the pressure cooker exhaling steam on the windows  
i barely noticed the F-104 Starfighter breaking the world speed record  
as the Sunday steeples trembled above the town and the statue of the doughboy  
looked down from the steps of city hall over the lives of those he died for  
all i saw was the light that surrounded me like ten suns   
that raised me up in its arms gave me a name that burned  
Bible verses onto my tongue and erected a Berlin Wall  
within my soul to keep out the Castros and their firing squads  
i was born to fill the quiet with the silence of the graveyard  
all those stories of the past whispering through the new shoots of grass  
and unfurling in the tips of leaves waiting to be retold and not  
forgotten i was born to be that constant fire in the bed of a nappy headed  
girl as our lives entwine into a great vine branching out in all directions  
and we speak this language of coal in low underground flames i was born  
with the Blue Ridge Mountains running the length of my spine   
its forests of flowering dogwoods sugar maple hemlocks and white oak   
i was born as the spirit of Jacob Fichman ascended into the heavens  
and left a little residue of the holy ghost on my forehead  
i was born into nothing and with nothing but dream to sustain me  
i was born to be one of those stones in the desert that moves   
a fraction of an inch each day in spite of gravity  
that leaves a trail through the dirt for others to follow  
and they do

## Looking for Judas

“Some betrayals are the cruelest”   
said the stranger sitting across from me on the train,   
our reflections bleeding together over the years  
in the cloud-darkened window.  “Don’t you think?”  
His eyes burned through the space separating us.  
But silence was all I had to offer,   
those denials and acknowledgments flowing   
through the undercurrents of a dark, unknowable ocean.  
As we sat there I could see his hands exactly like mine,  
his face a newer version of my face, that voice   
meting out every tick of the clock from the beginning  
of time as if it was a hymnal of my life.  The promised land  
always waited just ahead with its bushel basket  
of messiahs pleading for followers.  I chose  
my thirty pieces of silver, the hangman’s noose,  
the lone tree in the desert with its weakened limbs   
when I left him at the university gate, forever locked   
into his youth.  He was as much in love with the ideal   
as I was smitten with a woman, ready to drink  
my coffee each morning at the kitchen table  
surrounded by the sound of children playing.  
He held his bible of beliefs close, those prophecies  
that could save the world and seduce beautiful  
co-eds and professors alike.  But this earth was not  
meant to be saved, only endured, adapted to  
in its evolution.  We departed at the same stop,  
still strangers, twins separated by forty years,   
a single heart that divided like a cell, as we headed off  
in different directions, our footsteps echoing into darkness.

## Winter Afternoon in the Blue Ridge

Earlier he saw a bulldozer lower its shoulder   
like a rhinoceros as it strained to slice through the hill  
to cut in the new bypass.  Now the poet watches the pencil  
between his fingers transform into a black snake   
and slither away with his inspiration.  
Before him the notebook page is nothing but a long road   
filled with peril, lined by trees whose leaves   
have flown away like starlings in search   
of richer fields to glean.  No steaming cup of coffee 
will bring forth that swamp of ideas   
teeming with alligators, possums, raccoons  
and other creatures that steal dreams in the night.  
His soul is forever playing chicken with death   
like a moth before the flame as the fires  
of disappointment smolder all around in thickets of thorns.  
There is no short-cut carved through these mountains  
or divining rod that can reveal where veins of gold exist,  
or seams of silver or coal.  The path is always hard,   
filled with brambles and gullies, though his thoughts   
are constantly polishing his childhood to change it from a stone  
into a chrysalis where a butterfly emerges whole,  
its newly dyed wings unfolded and drying in the afternoon sun.

## Doors Unlocked and Wide Open

Your anger is a cold rain   
falling through the forest of my hair,  
pooling deep in the mind,   
dividing it into twos, fours, eights   
until I no longer recognize where am I.  

Your anger is a field of dandelions  
unleashed by the slightest breeze,  
a white that blindfolds our eyes   
until we can no longer see.  

It is a whetstone   
where the raw metal of our love  
is sharpened into a blade  
as showers of sparks  
burn stars into the black cloth of night.   

Your anger is our zen,   
our catechism of inner healing,   
our meditation on the nothing   
that is here  
and the nothing that isn’t.    

It cuts deep and true,   
a switchblade of emotion  
cauterizing the wound   
with its fiery glow.    

It carves the ring  
that bonds us together out of glacial ice.  

It etches our vows into the polar ice cap,  
the jaw bones of whales  
cast upon the shore  
that died speared in the hunt.     

Your anger is a fire  
only a shaman can touch,  
his visions bleeding an aurora borealis   
across the arctic canvas of darkness.  

It is a vine wrapping itself  
tighter and tighter around us,  
the woody fingers thickening   
into bars we cannot escape.  

Your anger is a magnet   
that draws us together, repels us apart,  
the poles aligned, then misaligned,  
this crazy engine that propels our love.

## Stillborn

Ghost    
figures   
imprinted   
on negatives,   
pall of holiness  
that shades your eyes from fire,  
all you can see is twilight  
ceaselessly surrounding you  
like a taut membrane, the world’s features  
written in a braille meant just for the eyes--  

who are these people whose DNA hides   
inside you, whose words pass to your lips  
like an oath of hushed betrayal?   
Your hair, fingernails grow to   
fullness, yet the sea casts                       
its tides against you.    
Into someone’s  
outstretched hands  
you fall  
naked.

## Cuttlefish

They don’t touch as they battle,  
the males in their dance of dominance  

and intimidation until one is left  
to gather the female into his tentacles,  

wrap his extra arms around her as he pulls her   
into his den, face to face, massaging her egg sack  

with his sperm.  The sea rocks their bodies back and forth   
to the rhythm of life being created, continuing,  

flourishing in the w of their eyes as their colors waver  
between light mottle, intense zebra then passing cloud.  

The offspring drift off on the tide, translucent  
against the turquoise blueness of the shallows,  

cutting through the egg casing, eating shrimp larvae,  
growing until they bleed into the sandy bottom,  

the limestone rocks, the coral, the seaweed  
as they ambush the unsuspecting crab or fish.  

When the fisherman’s net scoops them skyward  
they turn startled deimatic, flaming red stars  

rising through the brine.  The restaurateurs  
slice through the blanched flesh with their filet knives,  

paring the most succulent pieces from the bone  
for the risotto al nero di seppia the waiters  

present their loyalest customers, those whose rings    
glisten anciently in the muted light as if   

they were cast five hundred years ago in de Medici gold   
poured between the hollowed out bones of a cuttlefish.

## A Walk Through a Cemetery
 
What do I regret?  The hours  
not spent with you when you were breathing,  
laughing, gesturing like a fisherman   
reeling in the big catch  
as you told some whopper,   
expecting me to be the rube,   
the trained monkey   
laughing at every joke.  
 
And I was.  Always, no exceptions,   
though everyone knew   
you were a charming liar,  
the kind of conman who could slip   
through a half open door   
into anyone’s heart.  

Now it is your turn to listen   
over beer and cigarettes,   
your turn to keep your mouth shut   
to the sounds of backhoes   
digging the next resting place  
and cars rushing along the highway  
fleeing the sight of death.  

I’m not your sidekick any longer.   
I couldn’t save you   
with my poetry,  
or any other type   
of medicine or black magic.    

I am alone here  
on the other side of the grave   
looking in, wondering  
what it is like to be dead  
as the roots creep slowly towards you.    

This cold, granite gravestone  
doesn’t do you justice,  
stamped out like a coin   
in a factory  
with its carved letters  
and clichéd sentiments.  
But then neither do my meager offerings.    
 
What I want is your ear for all eternity  
to listen to my slow internal dialog,   
its incessant apology,   
and sometimes your lips  
to whisper anything back,   
words of encouragement or ridicule,   
doesn’t matter.    

I want you to hear me   
like the voice of that first bird   
in the morning as you lay in bed,  
clear and penetrating,   
singing out its love for the day,   
its resolution to live, fully.  
 
And I want you to believe in the song.

## Lynchburg Foundry, 1977

All it needed was Dante’s inscription  
above the entry gate. In my teenage stupidity,  
I passed through with my hardhat tilted  
in a backwards cool, the brim scrapping  
the nape of my neck, lured by the exorbitant wage  
of $5.50 an hour. The ninety degree summer day  
melted into winter as I stepped into the smoke  
and artificial lighting. The great blast furnaces gulped  
their iron ore, limestone and coke  
in a shower of orange plumes  
as spectacular as any volcano.  
I could see the heat radiating off of them,  
even through the darkness, while the cloaked operators  
moved the molten steel toward the assembly lines  
where we made engine castings  
for GM and Chrysler out of sand moldings.  
Here there was no color or status; everyone was black  
an hour into their shift from inhaling the smoke of burnt sand,  
wading through its tides. Yet the foundry had an eerie allure,  
a bewitching beauty that made me want to reach out  
and touch the liquid steel, feel the sting  
of sparks through my clothing, smell the singe  
of flesh over the hiss and rush of flames all around.  
My job was to shovel the sand that fell off  
the conveyor belt as the castings traveled their slow path  
to becoming a red hot solid, shovel what fell off of the shaker  
as the molds were stripped away to reveal  
the glowing orange heart of the engine,  
and toss any loose scraps of metal onto the slag pile.  
What circle of hell this was, none of us knew,  
or even dared ask the question. As the workers passed  
their years here, they descended deeper and deeper,  
from circle to circle, until black lung took them. I was in limbo,  
yet could see the seven virtues shimmering through the smoke,  
beckoning me to feel the sweat-soaked shiver of stepping out  
into that end-of-August humidity one last time.  
I still count my blessings by the burn marks on my arms.

## Time is a River to Kill
 
it had eyes and wings  
everywhere  
 
that’s why I kept looking at it  
 
when I should have been watching  
the dog  
plunge into the woods  
after a doe  
 
that’s why I cupped  
the gold from the surface  
only to have it disappear  
at my touch  
 
but just one kiss  
and I was hooked   
 
one kiss cold as a cellar door  
 
my eyes held shut  
as its blue dress folded around me  
like a volant sky  
 
then I saw coffin nails  
slide from the wooden joints of my boat  
 
the skeleton collapse like driftwood  
the prow become a gravestone leaning into the wind  
 
there’ll be no more plowing fields  
no sleeping in rooms  
 
thirst my star of pain  
 
steady as a fish in the night  
a dry stalk awaiting each day’s resurrection

## Portrait of My Mother on a Windy Day


Who is this pale ghost gliding towards me   
in the guise of Dickens’ Miss Havisham?  
Even in the fluorescent glare by the nurses’ station  

at the assisted living facility I can still see  
the candlelight darkening the hollows of her cheeks,  
reflecting dully in her eyes, her hair an unkempt, thinning grey   

in need of a beauty treatment, her lips pursed   
like a winded athlete, always whispering  
secrets to herself, instructions on what to do next.   

She lives her life in darkened rooms with the blinds   
always drawn, the figures of bride and groom taken  
from the tops of her wedding cakes sitting on the shelf before her,  

a kaleidoscope of family pictures that she no longer notices   
covering the walls, the Depression-era need to horde   
in the nick nacks from the dining room piled on the counter.  

The only revenge she knows now is time   
slowly removing the ones she loves, and leaving nothing   
but strangers who visit with their icy, unwelcomed hugs.  

“Tell me again how we are related.  I just can’t place you.”  
“Are you from Allen's Creek too?  Could we be cousins?”  
“There’s no way you could be a Doss.  You can’t be related  

to my first husband.  He was such a good man,  
cared so deeply about our children.  Do you know them?”    
Yes, I do know them, all too well, and have spent a lifetime  

being groomed to be the revenge for every opportunity  
she was denied, every wrong, every perceived injury  
from the orphanage to the workplace to the graveyard.  

For what seems like an hour, we practice how to insert  
the key into her door lock, turn the handle, open the door,  
remove the key, the same mistakes repeated over and over.  

Then we move on to the TV, the red on-off button  
of the remote. She practices changing channels   
back and forth as I watch her grow more and more transparent  

in the flickering light until I can barely see her,  
or recognize there is another person beside me  
whom I love and who now loves me in the third person.  

Saying goodbye, I kiss her on the forehead--   
“What did you do that for?”-- and step out   
into the steadying wind and chaos of the real world.

## My Soul to Keep

Only in dreams did I speak Iñupiaq,  
that ghost language of my ancestors,  
the syllables sweet as *muktuk* on the tongue  

as I addressed my forefathers. What I said,  
I don’t know, but they nodded and laughed  
in agreement, their ivory *labrets* gleaming  

in the firelight,  imaginary spears in their hands  
thrusting at some large beast swimming by.  
Awake, I speak the English of the government schools,  

that precise noun-verb-adjective-noun simplicity  
developed half a world away from the tundra  
and the ocean’s frozen fingers scraping the pebbled shoreline.  

South of us salmon run like clockwork  
from summer into fall, first the Chinook,  
the Sockeye, then the Coho feeding our brothers,  

the grizzlies and blacks, the eagles, the other tribes  
and sportsmen. They flock to the riverbanks  
by the thousands with their lines and nets  

to snag *kype,*  break the hunched backs  
to taste their pink flesh, while we wait patiently   
by our boats on the arctic icecap to see  

that first bowhead breath rainbowed in sunlight.   
Then we ease our wood-framed vessels into the water, paddle   
through the breakers to where the great beasts will surface next.  

We wait crouched like our forefathers, listening to the quiet   
lapping of water against our boat, tensed with harpoon in hand,   
ready for the miracle of life to continue   

for the next thousand years in  sod huts   
with their caribou pelts, or  manufactured homes   
stacked on pilings along  gravel roads   

with 4-wheel drive pickups and snow machines   
parked out front. The glide of the *umiak* is just like I remember  
from my dreams, almost slow-motion, yet it is filled  

with thousands of spirits, both dead and living,  
chanting softly to the whales and their ancestors,  
urging them to rise up, rise up, and take the next breath.

## Don Quixote’s Windmill

All that’s left exists     
solely in imagination,    

in those words that saunter into the future  
with their medieval swagger,  

an elegance hinged to a rusting    
coat of armor worn by a fool.  Picture it.  

The structure rises above fields of faded sunflowers,  
their heads seeded in prayer. White arms stained with age  

extend outward to catch the wind, yet hold daggers  
and swords silvered by sunlight.  They bend  

at the elbows, flex with a soldier’s prowess  
as the instruments of war twirl.  Trusses of wood   

stand astride like legs covered with grey clapboard,  
the rigid scales of battle armor that rattle  

with the stomp of feet, anchoring the giant warrior.  
The chest angles inward with a sleekness  

that belies its strength and power  
like the bellows of a forge where steel  

glows cherry red under the clang of the hammers.  
Atop the shoulders sits a head flatten in combat,  

the puckered face of a pig that sneers  
at its next subhuman meal.  At times like these  

the world becomes something more than just a splash   
of color on the horizon, a fanciful existence.  

This is personal.  Now mount that damn horse and charge.

## Buried Alive with Eddie


A pale hand reaches out in its opium tremor  
to grab you by the arm. But it's the eyes   
that really possess you, those Poe eyes   

with their undying devotion, that lingering grief   
that cannot be diminished, a mirror that transforms   
your reflection into the images of those you truly loved,  

the women who all died unnaturally young.   
It is the eyes with their ghostly blue   
like the dark side of twilight in a field  

of rotting Halloween pumpkins,   
like something unknown about to leap   
out at you from a cavernous darkness.  

Yet it is he who is mad, he who builds the walls  
around you out of brick and mortar, who trowels  
the entryway closed, and seals the mausoleum   

shut with a splattering of spider webs   
until only a thin thread of sunlight knifes  
through this eternal tenebrosity. Which of you will take  

that last breath of oxygen, you don’t know,  
but your hearts keep beating louder and louder,  
not like fingernails trying to scratch their way   

through walls, but like an entombment   
into those recesses of the mind   
where no one else is permitted to enter.

## My Love Affair with *The Final Problem*

It was the bleeding knuckles that worked me up into such an agitated frenzy, the forced peeling of skin like with an orange.  Assassins were all around, wherever I imagined them, in whatever dark corner of the soul that gave them sustenance.  I escaped their charms and curses, a shadow moving from light to light, almost untouchable, a thought that pierced their psyche with the blunt force of a cosh.  Whosoever would doubt me, needs to come forward.  The man was a criminal mastermind, a force of nature, not unlike a hurricane no one saw coming.  His schemes were so secret and diabolical, and dare I say it-- filled with genius-- that no mere mortal could understand them.  That’s where I come into the picture.  During the chase and the disguises from Victoria Station to Canterbury, across the channel to Strasbourg then Meiringen, the outcome is never in doubt.  The deceits cling to the soul stubborn as ivy climbing a wall of brick. I knew he was there like the shadow beneath the lifted foot, the almost unnoticed leaf that falls silently from a tree.  He was there like a single cancer cell rooted at the base of the lungs, dividing and multiplying with each breath.  Reichenbach Falls lay just ahead with the opportunity to kill both villain and protagonist once and for all, and be done with it all.  The trap is laid back at the *Englischer Hof.*  Two sets of footprints lead out into darkness.  Two bodies fall through the spray into the gorge locked in mortal combat never to be found.  Is it the end or the beginning?  There’s just enough mystery left to hear the whispers of *resurrection* rise on the reader’s lips.

## Have You Ever Dreamed

death is a mirror, a beautiful mirror   
into which you’ve starred all your life  
without even knowing it.  Some days  

it’s framed in mahogany, others in oak,  
yet all it reveals is the illusion of permanence  
like frost on a cold morning   

stinging your cheeks out of their slumber.    
How many hours have you spent gazing   
at yourself in this mirror, rewriting life’s fictions  

across every line on your face,  
the stories falling from the tangles of your hair   
in a highly embellished prose as storm  

after storm drifts in over your left shoulder  
with their sponges full of rain and lightning.   
Death is everything you ever did, each day  

flattened into a single sheet of reflective glass,  
everything worth remembering pasted  
into a scrapbook of all your favorite moments,  

even the ones you want to erase.  
But when will you step through?  When will you  
be absorbed, your life spreading out,   

expanding like light in a prism  
until you are nothing but colors  
bleeding from one spirit into another?

## The Hymnal of Life

on  
the  
yellowed  
piece   
of   
paper  
the  
handwriting  
that

## Jefferson’s Dog

From the dainty, well-manicured hills of France  
he selected me from all the other dogs,  
deemed my breed worthy to colonize the wilds   

of The New World, smiled with pleasure seeing my belly   
round with pup.  Six dollars he paid for me   
and my unseen brood before we boarded the ship  

Clermont at Le Havre.  He named me Bergère  
as I whimpered through the North Atlantic passage,  
giving birth to two more in a gale that rocked  

many a hardened soul into seasickness.  By the time  
we got to Monticello he set me down beside  
the figs, cork oaks, larch trees and the vinifera grapes  

that he shipped back.  I followed as he paced the slopes  
around the mountain looking for the perfect planting  
spot for each species, directing his people to dig  

here or there, how deep and wide, the right amount of water.  
I continued to follow him on his morning walks   
as he monitored the progress of each, watched some  

wither while others took root.  He was the loneliest man  
alive when the freeloaders descended periodically to eat him  
out of house and home.  He would retreat with me  

into his study for hours at a time, day or night,  
to pull dusty books off the shelves as I lay  
by his feet, or scribe his letters with the polygraph  

making an exact copy.  It was here he was happiest,  
alone, abandoned in thought, contemplating the sciences  
or philosophies, dreaming of those eventual flocks  

of Shetland he would bring back for my offspring to tend,  
the ram with four horns, and those other, more difficult flocks  
who would hang on every phase liberated by his pen.

## Invisible in Snowflake, Arizona


No one ever comes here willingly.  

When they do, they disappear  
into the high desert  
like drops of rain  
that never touch the ground.  

Off-grid, they live out of trucks,  
in tin-shacks   
without perfume, electricity,  
wi-fi or cell service.  

They wrestle with their MCS--  
the headaches, the fatigue,  
the wooziness--  
each in their own way.  

Some can only read books    
encased in plastic containers,    
flipping the pages using surgical gloves  
and Q-tips because of the chemical fumes  
from the paper and the ink.    

Others never touch a computer,    
soak any new clothes   
they buy in rainwater  
for weeks to remove   
whatever manufacturing residue remains.  

The lucky abandon their oxygen bottles  
and walk untethered   
through gravel and scrub brush  
on the way   
to making this place their home.  

But what do they dream of  
at night, with their walls  
lined with tin foil,   
and silver visors propped up in their windows?  

I dream of coyotes taking bloody bites  
out of the moon with their howls,   
javelinas stampeding   
through the wilderness of the heart,  
and homes that can think for themselves.  

Do they dream of electric currents  
that slowly dissolve their bones,   
the smell of colognes driving  
spikes of pain into their foreheads,  
motors switching on  
the static of the brain?  

Or do they just dream    
of the calm of nothing    
walking between   
sage and pinyon pine?

## Unsolved 

He entered the cab through the oncoming traffic.  
She entered from the sidewalk by the hotel bar.   
The heel on her designer shoe snapped like a matchstick  
caught between the broken teeth of the sidewalk. She cursed.   
He thought about the words said as the towel fell from her body,   
how they covered the walls of their relationship like ivy  
blocking out the sun and the rain, blocking out everything  
but the whiteness of skin. She pictured him leaning  
over the bed like a boy who'd just seen a woman  
naked for the first time, ashamed and curious,  
his body smelling like the earth after a spring rain,  
his mouth tasting of honeysuckle and sage.  
He remembered home like the distant howl of a dog  
in a moonless sky, its chain broken, running free.   
When he looked over at her and started to speak,   
she said the codeword.  The cabdriver   
with the broken Russian accent turned  
to face them and shot her in the chest. Her short gasp   
of surprise told him it didn't hurt much. He got his first  
in the forehead, then in the Adam's apple.  
The lit cigarette fell from his lips into her lap  
as his body slumped against hers, the smoke  
of the gun intertwining with the smoke still  
rising through his mustache. The cab drifted driverless,   
bouncing off of parked cars, its yellow mark left  
on each one, a burial ship lost amid the neon nightlife.

## The Poem


It may resemble the brow wrinkle in centuries of thought,  
or the baby newly pearled in its sea of creation.  

It will have hands stained with clay and oil, calluses the size  
of quarters, with an unexpected rainstorm brooding in its eye.  

It will stare back at you with the face of a boxer, puffy and scared,  
nose tilted to one side, cauliflower ears, and speak in the tenderest voice.  

But it will refuse to tell you its name or astrological symbol,  
or blossom into a bouquet of dreams when you hold it.  

It may growl, or stutter, or sulk in the corner,  
but it will never, ever save your life, or make you whole again.  

It will expect you to rescue it from obscurity,  
inflate it with meaning, the way helium flames   

raise a rainbow-striped hot air balloon,   
lifting it over trees and houses,   

guiding it on that breath of imagination that swirls   
across the plateaus of your mind as you look up in wonder.

## Revolutions

I turn the key in her forehead  
one full revolution when she is asleep  
to unlock her dreams  
they come tumbling out like bees from a cloud  
like water from a pump  

I don’t know if she is my one true love  
or if there is such a thing as true love  

I don’t question why she is sitting on the edge  
of my hat or why her dreams intersect mine  
like colors in a painting  
that run together to create  
such magnificent browns and blacks  

what stardust powders her lips  
I have licked clean like icing from a knife  
and tasted my own blood in her wine  

I am the mad hatter who serves   
a mad cup of tea  
my eyes glow like headlights like pinballs  
below my hat where my entire brain lives  
like another being I can barely communicate with  

before I cast my spell on her she was a flower  
swaying in the wind by a crystal fountain  

now on my hat the dial of the lock spins  
the hand of time parts the curtains  
to reveal our one kiss  
that takes place thirty years into the future  
then we part like an old married couple  
grown neglectful of each other  

but she is here in my brain in my dreams  
burning like a flame  
that consumes the tallow of my love  
until it is gone and I wake

## Touched

Like a dog with two tails  
that can’t catch neither,  

that’s how them townfolk talked him up,  
recounting all the episodes,  

the broken lightbulbs in the road,  
the geese in their hell-feathers,  

and the pictures of Jesus  
that walked out of every store  

to covered the paintless walls  
of his passed down shotgun shack.  

Whatever hand reached into the womb  
to strike him dumb, also made him a giant  

with no notion of his own strength.  
He was just the kind of man-boy  

who’d ram a fish hook into his thumb  
to divine what it’d feel like,  

then stare vacantly at the beauty  
of the nylon line   

dangling from the eye  
as it danced on the wind   

that blew between his ears.  
Everywhere he went  

that smell of kerosene  
searching for a spark.

## Fargo Snow


Crow lifted his head to watch   
his bones fall through the void like snow,   
empty shavings of a soul he didn’t have.    

His diablo eyes, rimmed in yellow,  
peered over the scarecrows in the meadows surrounding him  
to what he thought were mowers  
swinging their large scythes.    

His belly was hollow as a stump aglow  
in the fires of hunger.  He could smell blood,  
somebody’s blood, or his own blood, staining the tracks   
where the buffalo walked the day before.    

The wind winnowed his dark feathers,  
a kind of hand gently forcing him downward   
into a woeful surrender.    

He thought his own brains might have  
stained the snow like a yellow jello,   
or a risotto full of chopped mushrooms.    

Inside what was left of his skull  
the staccato of Freud and Pavlov bantered back and forth  
to a Mozart legato,  Were facts worse than the imagination,  
or vice versa?  Was fallow more desirable than feral?  

He then felt the Host bandage his wounds   
and raise him onto a cross made of willow branches.    

He knew the gravestones around him  
were merely doorways to another kind of letting go.  The dado blade  
of religion made room for what was missing.  

He saw the waters of the Red River   
glimmering like a shallow sea,  
beckoning for his footsteps, ready for him to walk across  
the glittering serpent of ripples to where Eve was the undertow.

## An Everyman Odyssey

She wrote in cursive across my body  
the story of our lives together, the decades,  
the children, the love everlasting.  It was a tale  
neither of us could finish, or even draft a clever conclusion.  

And I wrote my story of love for her in indelible ink,  
or with a typewriter, a computer keyboard, my fingers  
harvesting the ripe grain of her skin with each stroke,   
my lips white with the salt of creation, the pen between my legs  

accenting each syllable of our iambic pentameter.   
A life in verse, together, distilled into that gentle smile  
that first attracted me, the dance of blonde veils,    
a joyful goodness bubbling champagne from her eyes  

onto everyone they gazed upon. My jealousy wanted  
to lock world and family out, like a medieval earl   
building my castle around her hips and breasts,   
the drawbridge only letting in the invited.  

But our world wasn’t like that. It was an epic adventure   
in the domestic, the oracle silent except at night,  
when we wrote and wrote, students looking to make a name,   
yet refusing to dot that final period signifying story’s end.

## The Lion of the Blue Ridge

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Rilke’s Der Panther*

              
The circus cage rotted slowly in the heat, a curious tourist  
attraction parked beside Junior’s Old Fashioned Country Store,  
its Barnum & Bailey paint long since moldered to grey.  

Inside it, the lion of the Blue Ridge, defrocked from the big top,  
his eyes dented and dull as the heavy silver coins  
that changed hand inside to feed the economy.  

What was it they saw as the arthritic paws paced  
slow ovals around the rectangle of his imaginary  
African plain? Mile after mile of bars encasing  

a fortress of metal instead of the faces of the onlookers?  
Or deer rustling through the brambles? His own footsteps  
journeyed in ever smaller circles around the boundaries of his life,  

the predator's will cowering before meals of butchered  
cows and sheep. Yet occasionally when the powerful head  
caught a stray scent on the breeze the nostrils would flare,  

and for a fleeting moment his eyes filled with a blood-lust  
that raised the hair on his back, exposed the dagger-like teeth,  
extended the splintered claws for a quick kill  

before it sputtered out, slipped back into darkness.  
Then the wall of bars reappeared, the fumes of car exhaust,  
that endless pacing, pacing, pacing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longing for the taste of death.

## Protection

You grip the burnished stock and barrel,    
cold and imprecise, as though it were a handshake   
with a stranger.  It feels heavy, as if all the metals in the world  
were used to forge it.  It is a burden you bear,   
like a secret sworn not to be revealed,  
a special power conferred upon the good.  
No one will approach you or threaten your life  
when you hold it in your hands just so.  
Yet the coldness of the grave shudders through you  
when it touches your check.  Those nights  
when the wind sharpens its blade   
against your windows and shadows  
swim through darkness like a school  
of gar hunting their next meal,  
you hold it close as though it were a woman   
filled with pain and suffering who needs  
a strong but gentle hand to stroke a check  
or cup the narrowest curve of the waist.  
Those who are paid to protect always show up late,  
which is why you need it by your side,  
forever ready for the unexpected,  
asleep with one eye opened  
peering into the endtime.

## el lector

Some days I felt I could be Teddy Roosevelt riding high in the saddle  
charging the hills of San Juan.  But what was there to conquer?  
I lived my life amid the smells of loose leaf tobacco,  
sweat, salsa, and *ropa vieja,* the bodies fallen around me as I liberated  
the mind from the tedium of hands rolling cigars for the wealthy  
gentlemen of the south, or the dandies in New York City.  
Swords of light pierced the dust to turn brown skin  
browner, and carve furrows of worry into the *sueño americano*  
of Ybor City. My voice from the *tribuna* chipped through their boredom  
like the hammering of a chisel, planting word-pellets into brains  
teeming for stimulation. *Les Miserables* was a favorite  
as the escaped convict Jean Valjean outwitted Javert  
and showed that those who sacrificed themselves  
could indeed help the pure of heart inherit life's bounty,  
anything about the workers or the poor triumphing  
over the owners or the rich no matter how small,  
or the propaganda rags trumpeting out calls for the laborers  
to rise up and overthrow their exploiters. But most times   
when I looked down over the corner of my book or newspaper,   
all I could see were the meek faces of Jesus’ poor,  
the stone statues of unknown martyrs sacrificing themselves   
to a dream of a better tomorrow for their children and grandchild.   
The boiling blood of revolutionaries remained festering in their home countries.  
They were *yanquis* now, and I gladly accepted their pooled monies  
to play god, politician, hero or heroine on any given day   
to avoid the calluses, the tobacco stains, the squint-eyed monotony  
of taking a job below my designated station in life.

## Gone

It’s just like the dust from your feet  
to come visit me again on those nights  
when the stars lay their fish-shaped eggs  
in the corners of the moon’s smile.  

Envy can be as tough to swallow  
as bootlegged liquor made by my uncles.  

Some nights I dream it takes a hand of sandpaper  
to wipe the scales from my eyes   
and see what preachers say can’t be seen.    

You, friend, appear before me  
like the bleached Polaroid  
of a child so familiar with cruelty   
you can’t help but be kind to strangers.  

And I thank you for that, thank you for so many things,  
as I take your breath into my lungs   
to give voice to your words once again   
as a blue pen moves between blue lines.  

Are you not afraid of me? Or what I’ve become?   
I don’t know which of us wrote that,   
but the letters sound like horses galloping  
across this ground you’ve become.   

Your body is this giant tap-root   
feeding off of the darkness  
you loved so much.   

Your absence sprouts   
through the hardpan like kudzu.  
It climbs my torso,   
twists around arms and legs,  
shutting out sunlight and water   
until the host also dies in full bloom.

## In Another Life

There were many frontiers to be crossed,  
some imaginary, some real. I wrote so boldly there  
that my words had no choice but to scattered like cockroaches  
before the boots of the censors, slipping under  
baseboards, through heating vents, into light fixtures.  
They passed unnoticed through the cemeteries of buildings,  
cars, sidewalks and citizens who walked like upright tombstones   
with carved gargoyle faces freckled with moss.  What couldn’t be said swelled   
between the peoples’ sternness like a thousand Hindenburgs, each awaiting  
the spark of a machine gun burst. Checkpoint Charlie was little more  
than a one-armed bandit for all those Peter Fechters ready to risk   
their lives for the jackpot of bourgeois freedom. How often   
I dreamed of walking through the charred, bullet riddled  
skeleton of the Brandenburg Gate past the guard towers, razor wire,  
and the gnashing teeth of German Shepherds toward that other prison  
just on the opposite side of the wall where people were constrained   
only by the limitations of their intellect and ambition.  My prison  
was my room, that place of sanctuary, hidden from those   
who still believed *Arbeit macht frei,* their microphones   
listening within the walls for any subversive whisper.  
What they couldn’t hear was the pen moving across paper,  
my thoughts written in invisible ink, deconstructing their prison  
bar by bar to gladly build my own with its winding staircase  
descending to that hell where I speak truth to power  
between the barbs and stings of demons. *Folgen Sie mir,  
mein Freund.*  Our fate cannot be taken from us.

## Karma

1966.   Barbie.  Ken.  
Everything so perfect.  The world  
before death.& sex. No limitations.  
Money. Pink Cadillacs.  
The meat cut into precise  
squares.  Clothes always  
full debonair evening dress.  
Hand in hand. Hand on waist.  
Violins swirling. Don’t spoil it.  Don’t be anything  
less than now.  The war, a distant echo.  
Growing stronger,  In foreign jungles.  
Trees, Branches raised like swords.  
Fear that makes you walk into yourself. Slowly.  
Past corpses forged into armor.   
The light goes. On, Off, On, Off. Forever.

## Everybody Hates Everything

but that can’t be true  
not even her jagged smile  
that cut my mouth a thousand times  
a thousand different ways the lost road  
that leads straight to her cabin  
where her dogs eat whatever the gun  
kills the moon trolling in the shallows  
of the meadow for love-sick men   
only to throw them back into its cruel calculus  
that plots the limits of emotion  
but no it can’t be like that  
not here in the circle of Lorca   
where bi-planes still bear the banners  
of love and wing-walkers proclaim the divine  
majesty of angles with their daring in flakes of snow  
that swirl around the rose of her breast  
where roosters gobble down every negative  
thought that pools in the momentary impression  
of her footsteps as she walks to and from  
the clothesline to dry her things in the sun and wind  
and the grass of cemeteries grows  
untouched by the blade for centuries and centuries  
until all is forgotten even the very language  
that gets down on all fours  
and eats at us every day  
until we become nothing more  
that that same gnawing   
hunger we were born from

## Opening The Letter Once More


The heart at rest after its last beat.    

The words still clutched in hand    
squirm and stagger     
through their awkward emotions.    

It's always this way.    
No matter how many times the paper is unfolded,    
the scene played out in imagination.    

Outside wild turkeys glean corn stubble,    
scratch their hieroglyphs into moist soil    
for the young foxes to decipher.    

From the back of pickups    
hunters spotlight anything that glows back,     
teaching their sons how to be men.      

Bats dart between the glittering insects    
to where night flows like a river    
into an infinite abyss.    

The moon spills its blood    
across yellow pine floors    
where cold feet lie in laceless boots.    

And you are lost here, lost    
within the memories of an unworthy survivor,    
searching the graffiti-filled catacombs of your mind.    

Somewhere amid these lies you’ll find an everlasting truth.

## The Photograph

Look past the tanned, laughing faces;  
past the ease of friendship; past eyeliner  
and braces, perfect skin free of worry lines.  

The shadows around them say 11 a.m.,  
hours since oyster boats slipped through the mouth  
of the Potomac to dreg the bay’s beds.  

In the corner of the picture you see empty docks,  
gasoline pumps, a police boat swaying  
at the pier, the waters much cleaner  

than decades ago when soap suds and chemical froth  
choked the rockfish and suffocated  
the bivalves. Recovery can take decades.  

Now eagles and osprey swoop to snatch  
a silver gleam from the water. You set a sweating glass  
on the table, slip into grace you never see  

coming. Somewhere beneath the tides  
a body floats out of sight, one of the boys   
who jumped from the boulders on a dare, 

or the bridge  out of despair, a lone figure falling  
into grey water as miles away  
fleets of skipjacks haul in nets heavy with mud,  

clams, and eelgrass. What mother  
wants to imagine her son lifted  
by a cold hook as it drags along the bottom?  

In the photograph, there’s no hint of the tragedies   
of the past, or the tragedies to come, just the realization   
that gates of suffering are always open and ready  

to give birth— hair slick with womb juices, skin pearled  
to a waxy smoothness, the body curled as it breaks  
the surface, prepared to sing its wail of life.

## The Voyager

Your hands could pass for a strangers',  
gripping the sheet that wraps  
my comaed body, blue veins coursing  
like the waterways I used to navigate  

to reach your heart.  Full sail,  
I wonder if I'll ever come home again,  
the traveler in love with travel,  
circumnavigating the arctic seas  

of the brain. Tears only feed  
the churning waters, surging  
white against the hull.  Keep them  
to yourself, my love, diamonds  

hardening in the sediment of our passion.  
I have two kingdoms of firewood in my soul,  
two fillets of cod in the oven  
longing for the blue aurora of flame,   

and two keyholes peering into total darkness.  
Beneath closed eyelids a world becomes real   
as what you see and touch each day  
trying to wake me back to life with a kiss.

## Where the Vulture-tree Moves

I look ill, like a pumpkin  
that's been too long on the vine,  
like straw all matted and moldy  
where the horses have trod.  

The breeze pushes me   
through the barn door, across plowed   
fields to where the dead oak stands,  
black feathered, shedding its skin,  

the limbs in rigor, hundreds  
of shoulders side by side, bookends  
supporting those pink heads  
ravenous as the human heart in mourning.   

I unbutton my shirt, throw it to the ground,   
let the wind play its dirge against my ribs  
as I watch those gleaming beaks,  
the red-ringed eyes, and whisper  

*merciful angels, take this body  
piece by piece and give it wing.*

## History

only it never happened  

I let the barn door stand open  
so you'd think I was still inside  
as the golden-eyed owl  
flew across the meadow  
with a fury mouse in its talons  
at milking time when the cows moaned   
like seasick sailors  
clinging to the sun-splash in the east  

I climbed the ancient road  
where canes of raspberries arched  
in the mist like swords spotted with blood  
ready to cut the tongue with flavor  

below me where the brook  
etched its path of charcoal through the valley  
ruined farmhouses buckled  
in tangles of undergrowth  
the beams fallen together like hands  
collapsed in prayer  
a dark stain bruising  
the fireplace where it curved like a cheek  
and smoke fell across the shoulders  
of the mountains  
soft and fragrant as hair  

what was it you sang  
to yourself as your hands swished  
dishes through the soapy basin  
as your eyes fixed on that distant horizon  
or the rope tire-swing  
with no shoe prints around it  

I wrote it all down  
in longhand on sheets of notebook paper  
day after day not like some portrait  
at a fancy studio where they make you  
into someone you'd always dreamed of  
but hands at work a little dirt  
under the fingernails a few cuts and scrapes  
from digging blind potatoes out of the garden  

I nailed it between the studs  
in the barn 2x4s that I covered  
with cedar wood so moths  
wouldn't eat the words  
we managed to do without  
and blacken their wings with ink  
so someone else might find it  
when it's time to tear down and rebuild  
to understand how we were wed  
to this time and place  
two bands of gold locked in above the knuckle  
turning the fingertips purple  

it was gone in the blink of an eye

## Yonder


that place where you can look  
your other self in the eye and forgive  
how you killed everything you ever loved  

where your body melts into a soft bud  
on a hard branch that holds  
the statues of your ancestors  
bound with ropes of thorns  

where your dream flares up  
like a wasp's nest made of paper  
and sting after sting comes  
before your tongue touches  
the sweetest honey

##  Belladonna

stars swim through your eyes 
like minnows   
through a stand of reeds   

I hear the wind flute your name  
in hollow stems  
that tremble in the shallows  

you step forward   
from those shadows that command   
the vines to bloom  

when I touch you  
you come apart like a rosary   
in the back pew of a church  

the moon leaves no footprints  
where we lay  

soft mouths of deer  
touch  
the sweet grass of our coupling  

o how the black   
of their stares  
polishes my soul to perfection

## Prayer in Search of a Beginning

Two girls run away from the orphanage, stragglers  
after the plates are wiped clean and the clink  
of glasses fades like a key releasing the vulgar  
iron lock of the great doors.  The nuns are busy reading   
the heavenly bridegroom's miracles, dreaming of sundowns  
in a paradise of virginity, blind to their dwindling numbers.  
Sleek clouds, the color of overripe apricots,  
throw their blushing angels as bees bear solar  
gifts from seaside clover.  Whatever the girls are wearing  
falls from their bodies like leaves in an autumn park  
trembling before the dew of the moon.  The California  
mirrored in their minds drops trails of sandwich  
crumbs where their feet tread.  Their ears  
drift like continents of love over the gray  
sea.  Nearby a ship call death walks  
across the water.  They drink their felonies  
in wine stolen from the chapel, the cadence  
of their hands matching the inconceivable  
pattern of the waves.  Over the cliff an episode  
dies to be played out.  Whose spit stirs dust to life?

## Heimweh

Naturally I'm one of the stragglers,  
a loose string on a one string guitar that clinks  
out its only song in vulgar  
taverns where the men don't cotton to reading  
and writing, or plan for a long life of sundowns  
white-knuckling the steins.  I know the numbers  
on my fingers like a second sight of apricots  
filling barrel after barrel, coveting that solar  
eye on the back of a dollar bill wearing  
the skies green above the pyramids.  I park  
myself among the new shoots on the corner, California  
dancing on their tongues like the taste of a fancy sandwich.  
But our pleas for work fall on deaf ears  
as the hands grow a little weaker and gray  
circles the eyes, dusts the temples.  In dreams I walk  
with the jingle of coins instead of felonies,  
a gold pocket watch beating its cadence  
against my hip like a June bug on a string.  Inconceivable,  
you say?  Am I just having another episode?  
Who could imagine the year is 2009?

## Film Noir


call me the savior of moonshine  
unfit to lick your Daddy's boots  

call me the myths of regret reborn  
the lie that always tells the truth  

in the dark night of your soul 
I'm the wound that opens like an eye  

call me allegory of a burnt tick  
jerking through your dreams  
in 16mm  

in mine  
my words scale your body  
like liana  
for all the junkies to climb  
 
call me sphinx  
built by the slaves of love  

I always leave the screen door unlatched  
on the hottest nights  
to hear the whirling of the fan  
whisper your name   
across the fields  

call me singed hair  
clinging to the bullet of a song  

you're the lipstick print  
on the empty bottle left on my nightstand  

the alibi  
for all my futures  
perpetually forking through time

## The Hunter's Marriage

again I am the doe he has dreamed to life  
and I go forward to meet him  
as he calls my name  
my eyes filled with the blue fire of ice  
my heart about to explode  
like a kernel of corn  
fixed on the hot stone of his stare  
 
sprawled in the back of his pickup  
strung up in a tree outside his garage  
while he works his knife across the whetstone  
the dried blood caked around my mouth  
falls to its own death  
and I come towards him  
working the bullet up through my throat  
spitting it on the concrete floor  

I sit in his kitchen sipping bourbon  
from a glass starred with fingerprints  
thinking of what could really wound me  
not a kiss a glance or any other weapon 
not even what good slinks through his heart  

I whisper ever louder never lie to me never  
lie to me and I'll say I do  
like a fugue swarming  
from his speakers on a snowy night  
or that thing  
that makes him gasp in his sleep

## Neal Cassady Gets Rhythm on Rt. 66

the moon smolders on the horizon  
like a tick in an ashtray  

 I'm searching for a match  
just one goddamn match to light anything  

my mind races like a dog whose ass  
was turpentined by a bunch of juvenile delinquents  
reciting Baudelaire  

Acapulco gold Panama red but Hawaiian's best  

in these fucking mountains all I can pick up  
on the radio is some lame Johnny Cash  
and that double bass pounding like a migraine  

jesus h christ not even a pack of Marlboro's  
in the glove compartment  

just a Pepsi bottle cap a straight razor  
and Alan's Bhagavad Gita  

that little prick couldn't have left the Karma Sutra  
with its side saddle cow-girls and deep missionaries  
locked together contemplating  
the fast breeder reactor Armageddon  
of minds exploding in ecstasy  

now all i got is the drone of crickets in the night  
that Mississippi hick singing about a cool  
he'll never know  

not even a couple of buds or seeds to balance  
on the glowing coil of the car's cigarette lighter  
inhale the sweet smoke  
as though it were a gift from the gods

## Kerouac Takes a Swig

a haiku for all you novices:  
*Missing a kick/at the icebox door/It closed anyway*  

Ha! what a load of crap! should have written:  
the icebox is a woman in a tight red dress  
opening her thighs to flash a little beaver  
across the annals of my stoicism  

should have written: the icebox  
encloses my heart in a belly as big as mine  
I feel my blood pulsing through its veins  
when I open the alter of its doors  
I have come to worship those parts of me  
that are still inside:  

the gnawed roast beef sandwich  
hardening on a stack of Thelonious records  
the karma that was denied me  
filling the emptiness with a love and meaning  
I could never find on any nipple  
and these Budweiser soldiers  
in their neatly pressed uniforms   
guarding the tomb of the unknown  

when I hear the *pssst* of the bottle opener  
I know I am restored  
I was made for this rapture

## Basement Barbershop

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for Fate Brown*

Who would trust a barber named Fate,  
with Coke bottle glasses  
magnifying his eyes  
to double normal size,  
whose hands explored his counter  
like a blind man looking  
for scissors or comb,  
who cut as much by feel as sight?  

Yet each Saturday men and their sons piled  
down the stairs into his shop  
to gossip about the latest goings-on  
at church, hunting, football or baseball.  
Hours they would sit twisting the truth     
as the coal stove with its growling belly  
awaited the next gulp,  
and the jokes and stories grew more fantastic.  

Two chairs for one barber, the carpet  
of hair under foot grew thicker,  
and when my turn came I sat  
on a wooden plank hooked to the chair arms  
as I heard the buzz of clippers,    
smelled the Vitalis and talc,  
before feeling his hand on my head,  
measuring, positioning for the next cut.  

Usually a flick of ear or a honk on the nose  
signaled we were done, as I paid him 50 cents   
and he always handed me back a quarter  
with a pat on the head.  
My father, whose hair   
never got a chance to grey,  
went next, blind to what awaited him,  
that long, sad journey home.       

Now they're all dead and buried,  
whether they came by car or bus,   
their hair growing long  
and beautiful as death itself,  
no longer in need of trim or shave,  
yet their joy-filled "exaggerations" still linger  
like the smell of tobacco smoke  
in Fate's damp, musty basement air.

## Night Waitress

My face reflected in display case glass   
hovering over the pies and cakes   
goes unnoticed by those who enter.   
I'm nothing more than an invisible doll,   

stoic, but not beautiful, with the Russian    
peasant face of my mother   
who scrubbed floors her entire life.    
At this hour the men all look grubby   

and their loneliness fills the air   
like the smell of cheap cologne   
mixed with BO. They ignore me   
when I place the plates and silverware   

before them, hand them soiled menus,   
take their orders with the same indifference  
they show me. Occasionally I hear the ding   
of their phones as a chat babe   

responds to the latest flirtation,   
catch a glam shot of some twenty-something   
searching for her sugar daddy. What fantasies   
must run through these fifty-something   

year old heads. They aren't millionaires,   
or up and comers. Their calendars   
aren't filled with romantic escapades,   
just the loneliness of heartbreak   

and impending disasters as each new ding   
arrives with its message of hope.   
But are these babes real or just some Nigerian   
con-artist searching out the most vulnerable?   

I look at my own rough hands, the fingers   
thick and cracked from dishwater   
and wiping down tables. I have nothing   
to hold onto or call my own.

## Gazel of the Hometown

A ferry stop across the James River manned by John Lynch became Lynchburg.   
People kept coming to these hills overlooking the river to build a town called Lynchburg.   

I was born into a family stolen by time, the ghosts roaming the hallways   
Of our ramshackled shack on the borderline between the rich and poor of Lynchburg.   

I followed Thomas Jefferson’s footsteps from the boarding house on Main Street   
To where he'd dine traveling to his second home, Poplar Forest, just south of Lynchburg.   

I felt the old money snobbery of multi-generational family fortunes made from   
The slave-trade, tobacco, railroads, coal, shoe factories -- the economy of Lynchburg.   

I watched their eyes follow me with suspicion as I walked through their neighborhoods   
While the maids, nannies and gardeners carried out their duties for Lynchburg.   

I saw the railroad tracks buried beneath paved streets that brought wounded   
Confederate soldiers to make-shift hospitals to live out their last days in Lynchburg.   

I sat at segregated lunch counters, drank from the proper fountain, used the right    
restroom, always asking why, until those signs disappeared from the stores of Lynchburg.   

I heard the gospel echoing from an abandoned Pepsi factory, the choir singing,    
The collection plates being passed for a saved boy named Falwell from Lynchburg.    

Then finally on the orphanage steps, I decided to become my own father, own mother,   
My life born again, to be mine and only mine, unburdened by the history of Lynchburg.

## Doss and I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Jorge Luis Borges*

I do not know which of us is holding the pen now,  
nor whose thoughts drive the ink onto this page.  
Two ghosts live inside this empty vessel called me.   

One surfaces for a much needed breath of air  
and some idle chatter with the gulls overhead,  
while the other dives deep into the grotto  

of the soul, not to be seen for hours or even days.  
There's Doss the scoundrel, the braggart,   
basking in his own glory as if he were a Hollywood actor  

reciting words others have written so convincingly  
that he even fools himself into a tear or two.  
Then there's the nameless one,  

thin and fleeting as a shadow, vague as smoke,   
but oh what a fire burns inside of him   
like lava bubbling up from the sea floor,     

turning salt water into steam, the vapor rising   
like premonitions inside me, otherworldly visions   
of what has happened and what is to come.  

Those visions now guide the pen in my hand  
as words so foreign to me appear on the page  
written in a language I don't speak or understand.   

Then the first ghost surfaces to peer   
out of my right eye questioning everything   
I write while the other ghost stares out   

of my left eye urging the words to come forth   
in a rush of unforeseen emotion.    
Heaven help me if the two should ever meet.

## January Night

Listen......   
an owl in the hemlocks   
right outside the window   
where I type and type   

searching for my lost spirit,   
my soulmate, cast away   
somewhere in the vastness   
of irredeemable night.   

Who can the owl be calling   
in that forlorn voice   
so similar to my own?   
Will he ever get an answer?

## Ancestral Home

I hear that familiar groan     
of the pine boards as I step onto the porch,   
see the centuries old straight-back rockers   

where the men would sit in the evenings     
after a day in the fields with their rifles   
cocked and laid across their laps like freedom   

as they sipped the latest batch of family moonshine        
waiting for the stray deer to wander  
through their land or the unwelcomed stranger  

begging food and shelter for the night.   
I duck through the front door,   
bowed like a monk entering sacred ground,   

to find myself in the mud room   
where they shed their boots and overalls,   
before bowing again to enter the living room   

where the floors sway like the surface     
of a pond in a windstorm, and couches   
and chairs drift like abandoned boats.  Then I enter    

the kitchen, see an old electric range    
wedged next to the wood stove    
where the women rose early to prepare    

the biscuits, eggs and bacon and stayed up late  
skinning and gutting the kill of the day.   
Next, I follow a low ceilinged, narrow staircase     

to the second floor with its three rooms,   
each just barely large enough for a bed,    
a dresser and a urine jug-- life's essentials.    

When I look into the master bedroom mirror   
with its age spots, blemishes, and distortions,     
I see nothing more than a blank    

slate chalk board in a one room schoolhouse    
where their ghosts rehearse the abc's     
of dreams in crude, tortured letters,    
 
striving for the perfection that eluded    
them in life, telling me this is my endowment,    
this is the only place I can call home.

## So Many Questions

Where did you go that fateful day in April 1966?   
Last thing I saw was you laying on the couch   
after mowing grass for the first time that year,   
your arm draped over your eyes, your brow glistening  
with sweat.  There was no 911 to call back then.   
No ambulance came to get you.  You waited   
until someone could arrive to babysit your two kids.   
Waited in agony, wanting to rip open your chest   
and pull your heart out to stop the pain,  Why  
did the emergency room doctors not know   
how fix that simple electrical malfunction     
that can be corrected so easily today without surgery?   
Did you even realize you fell out of the car   
when the door opened, your head striking the curb?   
Did you feel the rush of angel wings all around   
as the orderlies lifted you onto the gurney   
and rushed you into surgery?  Did your hear   
the crack of your ribs when they opened your chest?   
Did you feel the shock of their paddles   
trying to restart the beating of your heart?   
Did you sense the letdown in their voices  
when they finally called the time of death?   
Did you hear them walking into the waiting room   
fighting back a tear to tell your wife the dreadful news.  
I can't even imagine her reaction. Did you feel yourself   
lifted upward, rising through the clouds    
to meet our Maker, the one we sang hymns to?   
Did he greet you with open arms, fold you into his breast?   
Did you see your funeral, the overflowing church,   
the people who couldn't get a seat and lined the aisles?    
Did you see my drawing of you that next morning   
with angel wings ascending to heaven as the sun rose?     
Have you been able to watch us grow up?   
Have we become the kind of people you wanted us to be?   
How different would we be had you lived?     
Or did God create a parallel universe in another dimension   
where we grew old together living an entirely different life?    
Show us a sign, any kind of sign   
that you are still there, caring for us, nurturing us.     
a bird call that sounds like your laughter,   
a butterfly the color of your eyes lighting on a blossom.   
We miss you.  Please wait for us, but don't lose   
that sense of humor.  We all want to hear   
some good jokes when we are finally reunited.   
We want to feel like a family again.

## Snapshot, January 1962

My father settles me on his lap.  

We are sitting on the living room sofa   
Watching television.   

I am the young horse    
Grazing on thick plateau grass,    
Galloping, shaking my mane.   

In the hallway   
Mother's making some loud noise.   

Father gets up to change the channels.   

Now I am a silky fish sliding    
Through the dark cool depths,    
Dodging nooses of seaweed.    

Click!    
A flash of lightning!   
The shutter blinks!   

Mother lowers the camera, smiling.   

*His arms wrapped snugly about me    
Like a safety belt.*   

*My grip tightening around his thumb --   
The throttle of a space ship  
That will propel me through time.*

*Already, the death-light pouring from his eyes.*

##  The Chemo Lizards

I don't even feel the jab   
of the IV needle in my arm   
anymore as the nurse prods   
for a vein in a swamp of little creeks.   
   
The bruises ripen like plums   
as she continues to prod,   
then sticks again in a different spot   
searching for blood flow,   
   
any trickle before taping   
the tubing to the hairs on my forearm.   
She hangs a bag of chemo,   
sets the flow rate as I watch   
   
invisible chemical lizards   
swirl around in the bag   
waiting to be freed to feast   
as they descend through the tube.   
   
I feel their excitement as they get closer   
to the target, feel them slithering   
through my veins, searching   
my body’s labyrinth for those cells   
   
they so love to devour. They are on   
a magic carpet ride to destroy   
the evil temple of cancer,   
brick by brick, mortar by mortar   
    
as they themselves die,   
exhausted by their hunger.   
I feel them enter my body   
week after week wondering   
   
When will it stop,    
when will the temple   
and all its rubble be removed   
without a trace. The clock ticks on.   
   
The lizards breed and breed   
back in the chemo lab.   
My hair drifts down around me   
like angel wings, like leaves falling   
   
on a cold, breezy day   
until I become a shining dome   
surrounded by followers   
all praying for the second coming.

## Visions

an owl    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling for its mate    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from a hemlock outside the window    
a teacup  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teetering on the edge    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a table   
a piece of grit  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that makes the eye  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water with tears  
a jackknife sharpened  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and folded neatly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into a pocket  
a witness to something  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can't be recalled  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether it's true or false  
an empty room   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with its spider webs in the corners    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead flies on the floor    
a ditch full   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of bloodstained hubcaps  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and abandoned wallets    
a deer's ribcage   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rising above   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its rotting flesh    
a vulture huddled    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over an unrecognizable corpse    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white as limestone    
an ax leaning against a tree     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready to strike again   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you follow incriminating footprints that lead nowhere

## The Angel of Numbers

Out of the sky, filtered between the clouds,   
rays of sunlight paint an equation    
across the chalkboard of the earth,     

mysterious symbols foreign to any mathematician.    
A universal truth that so many   
will spend a lifetime trying to decipher   

in their research facilities, with their super computers   
loaded with AI processors blazing away,   
burning up kilowatts of precious electricity.    

But what can artificial intelligence tell us  
that biological intelligence can't?  On cloudy days  
I can see the silky wings of an angel flittering about  

the heavens, checking on us, ensuring our destruction   
remains centuries away.  Guaranteeing mysteries remain intact.   
I see the protractor in her hands measuring the distance   

and angle of the stars.  I watch the compass plotting    
the trajectory of our fate as we navigate toward    
our uncertain ending, a poem still in search    

of a theme and its penultimate stanza.    
In her satchel, she carries numbers, sprinkles   
them randomly wherever she flies around the globe.   

They are for the children to cling to with certainty  
while she darts into the labs, a tiny spark from her finger    
altering the computers' memory and algorithms    
so God's mystery remains known, but unsolvable.

## The Angel of Deceit

Unseen, just over your shoulder,   
behind your back like a shadow   
lurking in the woods, hidden in the crowd,   

it is always there whispering   
in your ear, second-guessing  
what you hear, reversing what you say.   

Its smoky voice, loud, persistent,    
like broken glass cutting   
a wound that never heals.   

It says everything is false,   
made-up, except the voice that awaits   
you underground, that mirror of you soul     

trapped in its eternal dialog.   It's always behind you   
fermenting doubt, nourishing that invisible    
tree of evil that feasts on all your dreams.

## Spider

It stares at me with its hundred eyes   
in a transparent hugeness that cannot be seen.    
I watch it watching me, no longer moving,   
bleeding invisibly from its abdomen 
onto the hardwood floor,   
the stain like a birthmark on the face of a new born.   
For days I observed it, sprawled in the corner of kitchen.   
No one else could see the great effort it took   
to stretch its eight legs in an attempt to rise,   
only to collapse.  No one could see the tears rising   
in its deadly eyes as it struggled and struggled,  
The flies that landed on its head showed no fear,   
took a drink of its blood.  Meal worms    
scurried before it looking for any crumbs   
they could find.  All it could do was watch   
like a stone, unable to lift its own weight,    
unable to become airborne and strike,   
though its hunger wanted to transform it    
into something otherworldly.  What great effort    
it expended as it shivered, rocked from side to side  
unable to go where its eyes would lead it.   
What pain and confusion it must have felt unable to act.  
The body continued to lay motionless on the floor,  
a gleam of light still oozing from its eyes--   
like those dreams that fade shortly after the sun rises.

## Archipenko's Standing Concave (or the Glorification of Beauty), 1925

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*America is the only country not jaded or rent by war.*     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Alexander Archipenko, 1923     

How her beauty reflects in upon itself   
like light accentuating its own radiance.   

This could be Broadway or Times Square at night,   
pre Iraq, pre Vietnam, pre Korea, pre WWII,   
the doughboys forgotten as the stock market rises,   
model Ts flood the roads and speakeasies lurk   
around every corner selling good times   
spiked with bathtub gin, jazz, and dancing.   

She could be a flapper just stepped out of the bath,   
looking forward to a night out, gazing at herself   
in the mirror as she powders her body to an unnatural white,   
styles her hair in bobs, picks out dress and beads.   

A woman like this doesn't need a man, but enjoys   
their admiration, like ornaments that decorate   
her life, wealthy nothings to fill a knickknack self.  

And here she is, her silver slenderness    
before our eyes in the museum gallery, unconscious   
of our presence as she towels off, unable to hear   
the buses dieseling by, or the protesters outside   
chanting to stop the killings in yet another war.   
  
Completely self-absorbed, she wants us to forget   
everything happening in the world, renounce   
our allegiance to today, step back in time   
when she was a model in the artist's studio   
trying to pick up a few extra bucks, and his knife   
carved the concave splendor of her thighs,   
shaped her breasts, milkless and tight,   
rounded a small belly above the hairless V,   
when war in their minds was a dim memory  
of victory in foreign lands, a liberation.

## The Year of Soylent Green (2022)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The ocean's dying.  Plankton's dying.  It's people. Soylent Green is made out of people.*     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*They're making our food out of people.  Next thing, they'll be breeding us like cattle*      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for food.  You've gotta tell them.  You've gotta tell them!*     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *-- Charlton Heston as Detective Thorn in the year 2022*      

The eco-apocalypse is upon us again     
like every other year, every decade,    
a damp cloth smothering the world with heat,   
filling our lungs with the sound of June bugs    
as we struggle to breath through the smog.    

Bodies clutter our cities, humans, alive and otherwise,   
strewn about our streets and sidewalks like litter   
tossed from a car window.  Walking among them,   
we can smell the vomit and the fifty different body odors    
of sweat, see  bottles of booze broken    
against the concrete broken into green and white stars     
to slash a purse or a bleed-out a wrist,     
beside them the used, government-issued   
hypodermic needles that blasted someone to the moon    
and back cast aside, and ready for a refill.     

We can almost feel the emaciated ribs poking out     
of lifeless bodies like the keys of a xylophone     
awaiting the ultimate musician as waists shrinking dangerously   
small and the lines to the food banks and churches     
wrap around the block with most coming away hungry.   

But the oligarchs and billionaires along with   
their government empowerers have our future planned,    
and it is bright, oh so bright.  Imagine   
a world where food is plentiful and allocated freely   
to everyone regardless of their need.    

Imagine the oceans teeming with life   
and each net cast returns overflowing.    
Imagine vast herds of cattle roaming grassy fields    
eating their fill each day, chickens scratching the dirt   
as feed scatters like rain around them,     
pigs grunting at their troughs     
with full bellies scraping the ground,   
and fields swaying with ripening wheet,     
soybeans and potatoes as far as the eye can see.     

Imagine what miracles could   
be performed if we'd only give them our trust.   
The end of climate change, clean air and water    
everywhere, depopulation, abundance   
laid out before us like in the book of Genesis    
with housing and prosperity for all     
the government deems worthy to spare from euthanasia.    

This is the promised land that awaits, if we'd only give them    
our money, if we'd only give them our souls.

## The Good Angel

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Rafael Alberti*

One night while I was sleeping    
someone I didn't expect   
knocked on my window.    

I didn't wake, didn't move,    
but heard a voice calling    
for me to rise, saw     

it's feathers and swords    
flashing in moonlight    
like crosses twisting on chains.   

I heard the voice echoing   
through the halls of a cathedral  
filled with divine statues   
 
dressed in biblical garb    
towering over the pews,    
foreshadowing events to come.   

I found myself walking up   
the center aisle toward the alter,   
the church suddenly filled with people.   

I felt my hand reach out    
to grasp another hand   
stretching toward me from the shadows,    

a veil covering her face,  
a gown trailing along the floor   
as we stood side by side in silence.   

A voice said "Rise,"   
and everyone rose   
standing on banks of clouds,  

mountain ridges, in ocean surf,    
on asphalt streets, and when I awoke    
I was no longer alone.

## The Bellicose Angels 

The wind knocks at my door,    
taps on on windows,    
shakes the trees like sabers as a warning:    

they are coming, they are coming,    
to encircle the cities   
with their parading armies.   

They are coming    
with their tanks and missiles,   
their canons fully loaded.   

Cities of the north, cities of the south,   
they are coming in long convoys   
in their camouflaged jeeps.   

Their eyes are already on us    
as ariel reconnaissance planes   
fly overhead, mapping where we live and play.  

Their battle maps are already drawn,   
the strategy to wear us down   
like metal against a grinding wheel.   

But we are strong.   
The cannons speak to us,    
their melancholy rhythms    

like a song saying when to hide   
as buildings crumble around us   
burying our life stories.   

The dead souls of friends urge us on    
as a tower of skulls   
grows on both sides.   

The wind keeps knocking and knocking,     
trying to break down the door    
as we sit in our cellars and tunnels   

waiting for nightfall when the cannons    
sing to us in the voices of angels,   
and we take our guns   

and ammo belts into the woods   
looking for those souls separated   
from the battalions,    

the ones prepared to go to hell    
at the burst of an automatic rifle    
to meet their supreme commander.

## The Unknown Angel

The wings lay hidden     
beneath the shirt,   
flat as sheets of paper.   

The halo long since   
removed to rejoin   
the rings around Jupiter,  

voice now a guttural    
groan of struggle   
as he slogs about   

the city sidewalks    
as passersby often   
hand him dollar bills.    

The sandals are gone    
from his feet,     
replaced by tattered Reeboks.    

But still he hears    
the soft voice of God    
speaking to him through the clouds,    

hears people      
asking who he is     
and if they can help.   

And when his lips    
form an answer,    
a word that can't    

be spoken on this earth,     
they look at him puzzled    
that once he was an archangel.

## Song of the Luckless Angel

Hear the waves   
smoothing the sand   
on the beaches.    

Feel the wind    
lifting your hair   
toward heaven.   

Sense the earth    
shifting below your feet   
like those questions     

no one could ever answer.   
I am here, in each sensation    
pulling you forward and back.   

I am here in the wave,   
the wind, the earth,   
for all eternity.   

Look for my soul     
in the speck of sand,      
feel my touch      

in the gust of wind,     
sense my firmness    
in the steps you take    

across the land.     
I talk to no one, but I am     
always here, always in motion.      

Look for me in the wind,    
the wave, the soft sparks of stars    
that shape your dreams at night.

## The Undeceived Angel

In dreams 1+1 can equal 3.    
In anti-dreams 1+1 always equals 1.    
But 2, 2 is a number   

that parades around     
with eyes wide opened    
like a cheerleader in a short skirt      
shaking her pompoms.    

It says follow me,   
greatness awaits you.   

Follow me into the cities    
where living and dead   
gather to crown you.   

Follow me down    
whatever path I lead    
to your foregone destiny.   

A country longs to hear   
the fiery chill of your voice.    

A country longs to embrace you.    

"No, no...... stop tinkering with my nightly visions.     
Nothing awaits when I awake   
but the harsh sun of reality     
where I stretch my blood-soaked wings."

## The Lying Angel    

With words and honey    
dressed in damassin    
she speaks of anuptaphobia.   

Two people alone at a restaurant table    
staring over cups of tea,   
their faces erugate, smiling,   

but with contempt coloring her eyes    
as they meet at their parents' suggestion   
to end their lives of loneliness.   

He's halotic and she's meristic,   
in their own pygmean ways  
as he attempts to flirt    

sitting beneath elk antlers    
mounted on the wall above his head   
wishing he had a tyg full of ale   

before him instead of this plastic smile,   
the eyes with no depth, the nose   
like a raisin dangling on a vine.    

As the silences grew longer 
between them, she grabbed a napkin,    
wrote down her phone number,     

said please call sometime,    
I think we have something good here,    
then headed out the door.

## The Musty Angels

Today is that day, the day     
the winds promised so long ago    
with their smell of bitter almonds.   

You hear their voices    
in the drops of rain that fall    
randomly between  your thoughts.    

Urging you, always urging you    
to rise up on this sheath of air,    
to join their double-sided reality.   

Invisible as the soul, they hover    
before you like centuries-old blood    
that needs to flow through your veins   

to keep you alive.  You reach out   
and touch nothing but the myrrh   
and incense of their breath.   

Yet they are always there,   
whether you realize it or not,   
a chorus urging you   

to leave this earth, rise up   
on your hidden wings   
to fill the void between them.

## Invitation to the Air

Lost soul, lurking like a shadow     
in the back of a cave, twenty centuries      
of darkness surround your eyes,    
color each word that questions    
everything and nothing.  The truth,   
what is the truth? What is the eternal?   
Reach out your hand and touch    
the answer in the air.  Feel the wisdom   
of the air lifting you up   
pulling you higher.   

Shadow who never leaves your desk,   
never exits the walls of your house    
remember the air that first surrounded you  
at birth, recall its hand lifting you up,   
holding you against a light   
that cut right through you.   

Shadow in your darkest night,   
mining twenty tombs of rot and debris,   
mired in the catacombs of the past,    
reach out to feel the air around you   
lifting and swirling the spirits upward.  

Shadow leaving your humble abode   
to scale the snow capped peaks   
of your soul, feel the air around you,   
its tug and pull, its flirtatiousness.       
Then let yourself go, like a cliff diver   
springing out into the air, the air, the air.

##  The Ashen Angel

The smell of artillery fire    
drifts on the wind   
like an omen of what's to come.   

The sounds of pistols and rifles   
echo through the labyrinth of streets   
twisting and winding its way into your heart.   

The solemn vows you make    
as the sky crumbled into smoking rubble   
are repeated all over the city.   

100 apartments here gone,   
50 apartments two blocks over,   
the families now transformed into memories   

as floors collapsed      
beneath their evening meals   
before the homework was done,   

as fire consumed everything    
that wasn't brick and mortar.    
It was then the Ashen One appeared    

all over the city, emerging    
from smoke and flame    
in a thousand different disguises,    

enraged, and blinded by anger.  
The souls of those recently departed   
lie cradled in its arms   

to be lifted through clouds of smoke,     
break the chains of gravity    
that hold us so close and near.    

People in the streets,    
from their cellars and hand-dug bunkers,   
couldn't comprehend this level of cruelty.   

But you and the Ashen One could,   
whirling through nothingness   
toward the next journey.

## The Greedy Angel

In a town too small   
to appear on any map,   
people were standing   
on the street corners gossiping,   

staring at the man     
who was dead    
but didn't know it   
as he walked down the sidewalk.   

He wanted to rob the bank,    
steal wallets and cell phones,   
hack into online accounts, create   
a stairway to the clouds and stars,   

hitch a ride on a golden comet   
and buy what his soul   
could least afford,   
that unsettling blue   

of sky that filled    
his dreams with a wonder    
that would cost him everything    
and nothing at the same time.    

He didn't realize he was dead,    
even with the acetylene torches   
lighting the bleak corridors  
of his eyes and his brow furrowed  

with tunnels leading  
to the darkest chambers    
of his heart where picks    
and shovels still dig veins of ore.  

He didn't realize his body  
was air floating just above  
the pavement.  All he could feel   
were the rock slides of his face,  

the tiny explosions of dynamite  
in his brain as those around him   
saw the faint outline of his body  
slowly being absorbed by the sky.

## The Road to Lorca

Tongue-tied around your Spanish heart.   
like a dog that can't gnaw through its leash,  

Like a dog that just gnawed through its leash,    
you take the road no one ever travels,    
a road lined with wild raspberries   
with its three feet of snow   
where the dogs howl in the cemeteries   
for hours looking for their beloved masters
