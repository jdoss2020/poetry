## Today I Will Make a Change

Maybe, I answered to the graffiti on the wall above the urinal.  
Perhaps, if only things were different than they appear.  
Conceivably, if my power ball numbers hit tonight  
or I trip over my fairy godmother staggering home.  

Stranger things have happened, Lord knows.  
Lightning could carve its mark on my forehead.  
The finger of God could strike me blind.  
My testicles could shrivel into BBs.  

Who can say? But if the ocean can tear itself up like confetti  
then reassemble.  If a crab can grow a claw back  
lost in battle.  If a man can take a breath  
after the doctor has smoothed the sheet over the body  
and left to make his call.  

Maybe, just maybe,  
somewhere amid the horse shit and barn owls  
and the roads that swallow stones,  
like a faceless watch glowing through the well of childhood  
my masterpiece awaits.

## Buy the Ticket, Tame the Ride -- Hunter S. Thompson


Bible country. Protesters line  
the road to the Super Wal-Mart  
thrusting posters of bloody fetuses  
at the cars passing by, babies  
with heads caved in by the suction devices,  
torsos torn in half by steel claws.  

These are my people come  
from the wilderness to smite evil. These  
are my people moving through the desert  
of their discontent past the golden calves  
and statues of Ba'al to receive  
the words born by Moses. These are my people  
drinking from the spring in the rocks  
where the staff struck, eating the manna of heaven.  

I see them walking across  
the parking lot, fathers and sons arm in arm,  
dressed in worn jeans, glistening  
as if they'd just stepped  
out of the river with the holy spirit  
dancing on their tongues.  

In the produce aisle, they test  
the bananas, the oranges  
with hands hard as coal, soft as doves,  
always on the lookout for anything  
touched by the serpent.

## Jim Carroll (8/1/1949 - 9/11/2009)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*There ain't much time left, you're born out of this insane abyss  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you're going to fall back into it, so while you're alive  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you might as well show your bare ass.*  

I wanted to be Jim Carroll, sleek  
as a cheetah, skin white as the moon,  
a shock of red hair dripping  
onto my shoulders  
like overcooked cabbage, face  
gaunt as a Celtic death mask.    
I wanted to grow up on the lower east side  
shoot hoops on rusted metal rims,  
hear the music of leather against iron,  
sniff glue to the Stones singing  
"Love, sister, is just a kiss away,"  
put the spike in my arm  
to feel that liquid candy high  
blowtorch its way through my brain.  
Place me among the sweaty  
jock straps and gym uniforms    
of Catholic School, place me  
in the bus station restrooms giving blow jobs  
to married businessmen living double lives  
to pay for my next fix,  
place me with a pen between my fingers  
recording the DNA of all the dirty angels  
that cruised my alley-way dreams  
at night. Let me be Andy Warhol's  
gofer at The Factory, make me the om   
in Ginsberg's chant, photograph me   
as Maplethorpe's piss christ,  
dress me up as Patti Smith's rock 'n' roll nigger.  
Then set the guitar in my hand,  
my nihilistic Excalibur  
extracted from the shit of life  
to smite the smug and self-righteous,  
spark the fires of redemption  
in the oily sewers of my season in hell  
as I rise like a phoenix on pure lips of flame.  
Finally, let me die at my desk on 9/11,  
any 9/11, the hour before the planes  
hit the World Trade Center,   
scrawling my last missive to the world,   
each ass cheek kissing this abyss goodbye   
as I enter the next one.

## Alan Turing

I wanted to be Alan Turing, eccentric,  
reticent, stuttering momma's boy,  
riding my bicycle all over the English countryside.  
I wanted to perfect that blank stare   
of the idiot savant that infuriated   
his school teachers, gave those square,  
chiseled features an air of otherworldliness  
as he raised his head mystified  
they could pose such simple questions  
while his mind was occupied flipping through  
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  
I wanted to attend Cambridge,  
prove the *Entscheidungsproblem* unsolvable,  
argue with Wittgenstein about the absolute truths  
that could be defined by mathematics.  What could be better  
than smelling the damp pageantry of the oaks  
at Bletchley Park as he peddled his bike  
to the cottages in the stable yard  
where he tore apart Hitler's Enigma machine,  
deciphered the secrets of its unbreakable code,  
invented his own bombe to mimic the turn of the rotors  
and break the Nazi code as the Battle for the Atlantic   
changed in favor of the allies?  I wanted to dream   
the electric brain, the machine that could think  
for itself, learn and grow like a child.  But I didn't  
want to get the Oscar Wilde treatment,  
those female hormone shots to cure my deviance,  
feel the breasts growing beneath my Barberry jacket.  
I just wanted to love, undisturbed, in secret,  
like some sparrow that flies from the chimney,  
not a Snow White who takes a bite of the apple  
and never wakes, bluish lips and fingers,  
the smell of bitter almonds in the room,  
gone like those who stepped into the gas chamber  
unaware they could not be saved.

## Keeping the Corpse Alive

Take two lovely crossed legs  
on the other side of a lampshade  
and cozy up to my imaginary absence  
until I taste like the salt of an olive drowning in a martini.  

Roll your eyes over me like the ocean washing a man clean.  
Forget the jangle of keys.  I am a long hallway  
without doors or wasps or ivy or sleep.  Walk through me  
like a field of jasmine where wagon ruts cut a trail over the mountains.  

Read me like a book written in braille,  
a whirlwind of symbols you don't understand like woodchips  flying from an axe.  
Make me into a curtain that always shades the hours you should be asleep.  
Pretend I am not watching you watching me.  

Then imagine we aren't in the bedroom,  
beautifully parallel under God's perpendicular gaze,  
singing our hymn of hallelujah, hallelujah,  
always just as impossible as the first time.  

That we are two strangers gazing on either side of a shop window  
at a reflection of ourselves, that we are liars  
who always tell friends the truth of their tragedy  
without heroes or miracles or fights to the death.  

That life is nothing more than a flower in a lapel,  
the smell of shampoo in hair  
that tricks bees into believing  
the time for gathering pollen can wait.

## Abandoned Orchard

Seven hags on a hill beating a rug with their canes,  
these mysteries of love that keep us going,  
keep us from shipwrecking in the nights of our blindness,  
when drunken strangers wander off with daughters  
who are charmed by their bad accents, dime store cologne,  
garlic on their breath.  One day of silence,  
two days, weeks, the condemned and the protected.  
If they can push out a few blossoms why can't I.

## Loyalty
 
He was the only man I ever loved. Could love, really  What else can you say about the hand that feeds and baths you, scoops your poopies out of the back yard., tosses the ball until you get bored with chasing it.  I hate to get sentimental, but you know how it is.  *Just let it all out, you’ll feel better.*  I don’t know what I’ll do without him.  I didn’t even mind the smell or taste of his feet as I chewed on his old tennis shoes.  It was almost a mystical experience, like dropping shrooms.  *Very interesting, any left in the closet that can be shared?*  No, the bitch threw them all out, cursed his ghost for cheating on her.  But who can blame him for chasing any tail that can be scented within a square mile.  *Very true.  It’s only natural.*  He was good for me, so good, I’ll never be able to train another master.  *Now, now, I’m sure everything will work out alright.*  The whole house smells like disinfectant, not even a whiff of him left in the darkest corners. I’m going crazy, doc.  Uncontrollable scratching, clumps of hair caught between my claws, I must be coming down with the mange.  But in my dreams we’re running through the fields, chasing rabbits, flying kites, two perfect bodies in full stride, two bowls of happiness soaked in gravy just waiting for us to dig in.

## How the Name is Spoken

He has a face like a grasshopper.  
When he yawns his mandibles  
move like the arms of a combine   
chewing row after row in a corn field.  
His siliva stinks as bad as a spittoon   
sloshing month-old tobacco juice.  
I empty him from my mind, take the hook   
and thread first through one rainbow-colored eye   
then the other. The fish shoot like stars across the night sky,  
color my black flag of surrender with skull and crossbones.  
I cast the body where the moon ripples into a mouth  
large enough to swallow the world, small enough to spit gristle.

## How Big is Infinity

First put on God's death mask.  
Peer through the eye-holes as if you were some all knowing being.  
Grab each end of the universe and stretch it like molten glass  
and then stretch it some more until it shatters into a thousand pieces.  
Keep repeating until someone asks you what you're doing,  
why not take a coffee break.  So you sit down with him  
at the counter of a diner, run your finger around the lip of your mug,   
savor the aroma curling toward you like a steamy question mark.    
That stranger, now your friend, seems a lifetime away   
sitting on the stool beside you, patting you on the shoulder.  
He speaks, but the words can never catch up.

## Biograph Theater
 
You are the cigarette dangling from pursed lips, and I,  
I am the match that flares to illuminate your features,    
casts the shadow of your profile into deeper nuance   
until the mystery that is hidden behind layers of mascara   
flakes down like ash to soften this black and white shot,  
and the director zooms the camera lens in tighter to capture  
the smoke that questions our being, the kiss of lipstick,  
the breath now visibly flowing between us, shared  
like bootlegged liquor.  I don’t know if you’re the secret  
of secrets, the one who has no name, the words my soul  
burnt itself up to hear.  You smell like a rose plucked  
from the barrel of a Tommy gun, so dirty only fire  
can make you clean.  I bring you my drop of blood,   
my tear of sulfur and all the hurt one life can muster.  
My body is left spent on the sidewalk, the glow dimming  
in my eyes as you slip through the gathering crowd,  
and your red dress fades into a darker gray before the camera  
pans out and no one here follows you into history.  
pans out and there's no one left to follow you into history.

## The Visitors of Night
 
You are like a wine bottle three people drank from, twist top, and I,  
I am the fire they squatted in front of spinning their yarns,  
casting dice in the moonlight, deadeyed as the steel  
firing pin that sends the bullet in motion, biting as the knife  
that carves our initials into every tree.  Is this love, the singer  
wailed over the dark forest we roamed searching  
for squatter's rights, a warm place out of the wind.  The hollow,  
well-trampled, where they settled for the night grew into a home,  
a place where the branches weaved a roof above our heads.  
Here I came to love these dirty fingerprints they left on your body,  
the smear of their lips on your month, the dregs they left in your soul   
that longed to be replenished.  Here you grew to cherish the ash   
and charcoal that is my eyes, my lungs, my spleen, and the blood  
that flows through my veins like acid.  The skull  
of the small animal they ate, its bones, are scattered in the shape  
of that constellation we swore on called Orion the hunter.  
Their feet may be long gone, but their cruelty joined us together,  
sure as any arrow that splits two hearts in its random flight.

## Dadascope
 
what if the tourniquet around your neck  
were suddenly released  
and the blood rushed back into your pupils  
and you could now tell the exact time of day  
from the shadows cast by women in high heels  
see the birds nesting in their ballerina hair buns  
taste the black wing of flight  
the chauffeur opens the door  
for today’s new nobody  
there should be boats  
there should be a dreamscape  
there should be hands ascending like balloons  
the soul hums in the cavernous quiet of its hive  
your eyelids fall like guillotines  
on each image that leaves and enters

## The Unvanquished

They had that "you can trust me with your life" smile,   
the twinkle of a shooting star in their eye,  
and the swoop of hair cresting the forehead  
that made women want to hang ten in its surf.  
How long had I watched my father and the President  
crack jokes in stereo, one on TV, the other in the living room.  
Now there was no joy seeing the caissons roll  
past the Capital, the riderless horse with boots turned  
backward in the stirrups clop its lonely path toward forever.  
Why must people die?  I asked the blank stare,  
the upturned cuffs, the pencil holder  
in the shirt pocket, the pipe with its smell of gunpowder,  
my words reverberating in the silence   
of the grassy knoll.  Three years later his own heart  
assassinated itself, a single bullet coursing  
through his veins, the ex-Marine felled  
by what he couldn't see coming,  
the triangle of flag presented to me by the honor guard,  
the snap salute of a grateful country,  
that question still burning in my mind like an eternal flame.

## Inventing God

Does He know I exist?  Of course He does,  
He is everywhere, knows everything, no one can hide,  
my father said, his willowy mustache dancing on his lips,  
fingers taping nervously on the hymnal to the slow grind of the organ.  
But when the preacher's Old Testament voice boomed from the pulpit  
I knew I must make myself small as a speck of dust carried unseen on the wind.  
I must hide where not even the badgers can go,  
veined like minerals, untouched by shovels, sleeping the deep sleep of the earth.  
I must have the tenacity of rust hiding beneath the paint of an iron bridge,   
growing below the exterior in the darkness and rain  like a cancer.    
I must be so strange He will look past me in pity and embarrassment  
He could have created such a creature.  I must never comb my hair,  
carry the snag of cockleburs with me like the vermin of a plague,  
or make myself attractive in any way.  I must bear the wayward  
thoughts swimming through the brains of all these women  
filling the pews with their self-pity, a crow-like remorse cawing over their bodies.  

Or should I make myself large as the sky, storm clouds rolling  
across my eyes, lightning flashing from my teeth? Would He  
fail to notice me then, looking right past me like Rilke's panther  
subconsciously block out the bars of its cage? Or should I come to Him  
like rain in the apple, the snap of its core as the sugar is released?  
Should I hide beneath the lichen that clings to the bark as the heartwood  
draws the coolness of the earth into its spin. Should I laugh  
when he laughs, cry when fire sweeps across the mountains,  
open my marrow to his speaking in tongues? I must strip back my covers,  
make a place for Him, open my legs to receive the Word,  
feel the doughy babies scream their first breaths in the dust of His arms.

## I Reclaim
 
I reclaim the forty acres of my closet I let lie fallow,  
the blisters rising on my palms like bloody moons    
as I till the soil harvesting its crop of skeleton keys.  
 
I reclaim my bed that kneels in the corner  
like a monk with folded hands  
sworn to silence for the crimes of my dreams.  
 
I take back all the shiners I gave and received  
on the playgrounds, a stray dog scratching  
behind itself with a Dylan Thomas flair.  

I draw the bow of regret tight against my cheek,  
let the arrows fly like Odysseus confronting the suitors  
in the guise of my older self to take them out one by one.  
 
I gather all those “you’re not good enoughs”  
rolling off the teachers’ lips into a bouquet  
of blood red roses to give to my one true love.  

I dust off those tools I used to jimmy  
my way into people’s hearts,  
to pick the locks of the past.  
 
I reclaim that boy with the crew-cut  
always dressed in someone else’s hand-me-downs  
waiting behind door number 3.  
 
I take him just as he is, crooked teeth, bruised knuckles,  
Technicolor visions blooming in his eyes  
the same way moss always grows on the north side of trees.  

-----------
Technicolor visions blooming in his eyes,  
the babble frothing on his lips like some kind of hillbilly poetry.

## I Reclaim

I reclaim all the hours awake by the window  
writing messages of moonlight  
in the voice of Billie Holiday   
played through an old Victrola needle.    

I reclaim the secret life of the gigolo  
standing half in light, half in darkness  
like a deck of marked cards  
I can recite by memory, identify by touch.  

I reclaim that lightning before death  
that burns the pillows of the sick,  
leaves their silhouettes humming  
the last refrains of favorite songs.  

I reclaim the mud of the grave  
raining down like a fugue   
on the rest of my life   
with its scales and repetitions.  

I reclaim all the scars   
that can't be seen with the naked eye,   
covered under by the snowfall of skin   
hiding those embers that still burn.  

I reclaim those words of love and hate  
whispered over the phone,   
in the woods and on playgrounds  
with their thorns and blossoms.  

I reclaim that innocence that left   
like a sick dog to find a private place  
to expire, its rib bones gleaming white  
through the soil like swords of truth.  

I reclaim that snot-nosed brat  
of the black and white photographs,  
arms crossed in defiance,  
the loathing turning his eyes in searchlights.  

Each night I give him the spankings  
he deserved but never got  
to see the tears stream down his face,  
to wash away the pain of what can't be undone.

##  Saved

It could have been the copper penny  
you tucked into the crease of your loafer   
after it was flattened on the train trestle   
as the locomotive shook 
the blue out of the sky.  

Or the kiss that hovered somewhere  
between imaginary and real  
in the alcoholic haze of the dance floor  
as the boom of the bass  
pierced a strobe of black lights.  

Or the water the preacher's  
strong hands submerged you in  
as he spoke the words of the dove  
over your helpless body, and you rose  
to see it flying through rays of sunshine.  

Instead of the cold nose that nudges  
you out of your funk, the shiny coat of fur  
you pulled from the flames before the building   
collapsed and continues to collapse  
on everything you ever loved.

## Orphan

The hand that took mine   
was not called love, or caring, or tenderness.  
It was calloused and hard    
like the boots they put on my feet,  
the comb they raked through my hair.  

Lye soap could not scrub them off of me  
like a stain that barely faded with time,  
a birthmark that blended in with the burn  
of sun scorched fields where hay  
and corn were bundled for the livestock.  

Parents, what are they but memory  
in a land where only the present counts,  
where the chores always lie in front  
and the home with its rows of beds  
and Gothic spires hunches over my life.  

Childhood of dirt and beans,   
ivy covering the railings, the eyes  
of all who would peer inside  
see there is nothing here,   
nothing but the longing to be held.

## The Way It Is

This poem is not about the last possum,  
its eyes shining like large drops of dew  
in the moonbeam of our headlights,  
the seed of its race concealed in womb or scrotum.  

It's not about the shriek in your voice to slow down,  
the air pregnant with emptiness between syllables,  
the fine hair of your arms bristling in the green illumination  
of the needle pointing to the speed limit.  

It's not about the gravity that draws the waters of your belly  
forward in this tide that teems with a single life  
that will change our lives irreversibly  
with its first gasp of air as it slithers from its salty cave.  

The trees wave goodbye from the side of the road.  
They always wave goodbye like virgins watching  
their true loves march off toward the glory of war.  
But where is the glory?  The poem is nothing  

but breath passing beneath the undercarriage,  
streaming unseen across the windshield like so many unkept dreams.  
I feel the grasp, the nails, the tickle of blood, the impact,  
then it plays out in reverse.  Wheels on pavement  

hum a lullaby to lure us into that sweet mental sleep  
where time is not even the tick of a clock  
or the rhythm of a wave sculpting the shore,  
that pod we launch from and return to, us non-survivors, all.

## Dust to Dust


I am the dandruff of Jean Coucteau  
falling through your dreams   
to cover your loveless misery. 
I am that film of dust  
on the looking glass  
you step through  
to enter the underworld.  
I am all that’s left of your husband,  
powdering the shoulders of his suits  
like regret. I am that Orphic pollen  
that fertilizes your life  
from the back row of a cinema.  
I am the gate, the key,  
the magic potion that lets you look  
in the rear view mirror,  
possess him again for a moment,  
keep him from turning to stone.

## Note to the Goatman of Glen Dale
 
A schoolboy's bad moon carves its way across the sky  
the same way your teeth rake the throat of a beautiful girl,  
feel the snap of the apple as it breaks in two.  
I'm not scared sitting by the crumbling chimney  
that looks like a crippled hag, hearing the frogs chirping  
by the ruins of the asylum. What mad scientist unleashed you  
on the world?  What failed government experiment  
left you so disfigured?  You search for the college of nightfall  
where the coeds bloom every time they dream   
wrapped in the white sheet of the dead.  Your hooves  
leave their hexes on this ground washed down from the mountains.  
I track you like a dog in autumn, smell your sad hesitation  
before the fog of blood, the stone thighs of the Virgin’s statue.      
I want to tell you how the poet always cuts his pen  
on the death of other poets, how the words blow  
through the woodwind of the ass like a gun in the hands of fool.  
But you are eternal as the weed, a boat cutting through the river of stars,  
never seen, but everywhere trouble is just beginning, and I your compass.

## To Huckleberry Rimbaud from the Hotel New Orleans
 
I think of you as a rock falling in a deep channel,  
wavering through the depths, your mouth filled with the muck  
of the bottom, that cathedral of compost and whisky bottles  
where the eleven lives of madness are worshiped.  But the lies  
you tell drip with the truth, boy-strong, eating away at the brain  
like raindrops of cancer.  You’re constantly being reborn  
without myth, your heroes, their victims, beyond each era’s  
tragically black comedy.  Only the daintiest of poets   
would perfume the roses in a garden, while I quake  
at the sound of your Redwings’ ax strokes across the dock.  
Any dog can sniff out where you’ve left your bullets of love,  
but why should I not believe in your tongue, that raft  
journeying down the Mississippi, nothing more than saplings  
lashed to a prayer.  Memphis, cold jewel shimmering in the belly  
of a dancer, play me like a mandolin, as I watch a fool fan  
the bonfire of his manuscripts, become the blank page once again.

## Spell
 
all you remember  
skimmed through like a cheap novel  
 
nothing but pain  
your star  
dot of blood tattooed inside the eye  
 
set your compass  
to its glow  
 
see  
the darkness that blazes  
in your shadow  
 
you know the destination  
so well  
 
a kiss    
searching for its target  
 
blue yodel of the mountains  
in your voice  
like a passage from the bible  
 
a blackened thumb  
blots out  
the eye of the night

## God’s Silence
 
I do not hear it in the drumming of fingers on the desktop   
coming from the other room as my son kills and plunders  
his way through World of Warcraft.  I do not hear it  
when I lock my thumbs and unfurl the shadow of a bird  
against the wall to watch it soar above us.  Even in the water  
rushing over algae covered rocks where the mayfly larvae,  
crayfish and salamanders struggle to maintain their hold,  
it is an absence I don’t lament.  I watch the sky redden  
in the west as the deer creep out of the woods into my yard,  
their mouths like hymns of praise for that sweetest weed  
that seems to grow nowhere else in the neighborhood.  
I don’t hear it when I pick up the pen to jot down   
the day’s thoughts, stare out the window to see the stars  
burning through the bloody swirl of night, or when your arm  
circles my waist and our hands catch like the clasp of a necklace.  
It escapes me when I close my eyes quiet as mirrors  
and drift off to sleep feathering the canoe of dreams  
onto that still lake where the mist rises and the loons yodel.  
It escapes me everyday, like the touch of wings that can’t be felt,  
as I walk through the world looking for that room with its naked bulb  
and holy cussing scrawled across the wall, and rejoice I never find it.

## Diamonds

Bless the lion-hearted gypsies asleep  
on the ground beside their cars  
as the trees above drip dew,   
into their hair, their beards, 
these beads of water that gleam in the moonlight  
like worlds peopled with the longing for escape.  
A dog's howl becomes the long bow-stroke of a fiddle,  
the rustling of leaves a tambourine.  I hear feet  
dancing in the meadow, and imagine a fire  
leaping into the sky.  Each day I wake looking for  
that random smile, a wink, those skilled fingers  
that can enter and exit a pocket unnoticed,  
extract a day's wages.  Who am I to complain  
if this happens to me?  Now I see these constellations   
of droplets gleaming in hair black as night,  
strewn across blankets, intertwined,   
the way the universe is shuffled together  
like a deck of cards, joining them in a kind of marriage.

## Fragile--

what I am not: a mirror, flat,   
brooding, self-absorbed,  
admiring my own image.  

My fiends say  
I'm about as sensitive   
as a troop of children who trample  
through a farmer's wheat field  
chasing finches into the sunset.  

What makes me   
want to be so alone,   
the light inside burning   
like a TV that replays many dramas?  

The lunatic in my left hand  
demands a ceremony   
where only blood will gratify.

## Gratify

In Magritte's painting *Plagiarism*  
it's too easy to say: art imitates life,  
or that art is the fingerprint of the soul.  
Your own world remains flat, pre-Columbian,  
with monsters and precipitous drop-offs  
on either side of sunrise and sunset,  

not a globe trampled by irresponsible children  
who backpack off to other countries  
on their parent's nickle.   

The rooms are filled with the songs  
of finches, their nests cut out  
from the wallpaper, filled with eggs,  

as they glean the carpet for seeds,  
hop through tree limbs, build a life  
for themselves within these boundaries.  

What blooms on the table, blooms inside  
the mind as well as outside these walls,  
each mirroring the other's reality.  

You can smell the musk  
of the damp soil of spring,  
feel the pollen irritating your nostrils,  

and this art is undefinable, though you leave   
your prints all over it, allergic to the beauty,  
savoring it every chance you get, alone.

## Instructions on How to Write a Love Letter

1.  Combine the blood of a carrier pigeon,  
and the song of a nightingale,  
stirring briskly.  

2. This shall be your ink,  
bottled and slipped into your pocket,  
along with a Turkey quill behind the ear.  

3.  Board a ship called Night  
with its crew of refugees  
who have all sailed past the point of heartbreak.  

4.  Cast your eyes upon the moon  
as you leave the harbor.  

5. Stare at it until it becomes  
the object of your affection--  
her skin the color and taste of sweet cream,  
her nipples ripe as cherries,  
the green of her eyes  
a night blooming vine  
that wraps itself around you  
until you're intoxicated by its perfume.   

6.  Hear the duel for your heart and soul 
as cutlasses clash and dark figures   
parrying in the shadows.  

7. Suddenly it occurs to you that everyone on-board  
is really just another you in disguise  
as you start to feel every cut, every rope burn.  

8.  Now set pen to paper, and record   
all your sensations, especially those  
where you think you've died for love.  

9.  Forget that one of your joker selves  
forgot to tell you this was disappearing ink  
so you can mean it and take it back  
all at the same time.  

10. Lick the envelope shut,  
then strap it to the back of a passing   
loggerhead paddling toward  
his ancestral breeding grounds  
where your lover awaits  
under swaying palms   
cradling the moon in her arms.

## Chess


The reflection of the game board  
divided his eyes into 64 equal squares,  
64 views of reality.  *You'll need to think  
5 to 10 moves ahead to be any good,*  
he said, stroking his beard like some feudal lord   
teaching his son the laws of the land.   
I watched his nicotine-stained fingers  
grasp the knight, move it in an odd L-shaped pattern.  
My own hand didn't know whether to move the rook,  
the bishop with its sharp angles, the blood-thirsty queen,  
the timid king, the pawns with their shields and spears.  
But he reached across the board, guided my fingers  
to the right piece.  *Like that,* he said, *classic defensive move  
from the book I loaned you.  Memorize it. Recognize the patterns.  
Become your own computer.*  He always played all out,   
never giving any quarter, even to newbies.  *Only way to improve   
in this world where it is war all the time  
and games are more than just games.*

## Amanda

Already, I can see your absence    
broadening like a shadow    
in the fading candelabra of your smile.    

Grasp my hand, little one,    
and lead me to the piano again,    
if only in my mind.    

Inside you are cells like warring armies    
that divide and conquer    
while we who hold vigil    
witness this negative miracle.    

I want to feel your fingers on my arm    
playing the Bach scales    
the two of us    
grew to love so much,    
the melody never left the imagination.    

Life and death, which is the impostor?    
We all know the answer.    

Though you’ll never have your moment on stage,    
breathtaking in a red dress    
bowing before applauding audiences,    
you’ll catch the single white rose    
I toss on your grave like a virtuoso    
and carry it with you forever.

## Indiscretion

This year's deer hobbles forward, balanced on three legs,   
dragging the fourth limply behind it like a sigh of regret.  
Only a car could have inflicted such wounds, yet  
the child survives and munches what green   
remains in the yard. I watch from a window  
fogged over with breath and the steam of tea.  
Earl Grey and its bittersweet touch of Bergamot  
fills my senses, the taste of you always on my tongue,  
every sip a reminder of what's it like to be alone  
without laughter and the smell of a woman  
in the house. The holiday ornaments are still up  
and reflect the splendor of unopened presents.  
Frost comes hard at night and in waves  
like this so-called wisdom that turns a head white  
and leaves little hope for surprises, save one.

## Inheritance

My father is growing wings.  Somewhere in the stratosphere of his imagination,   
he unfurls them where the bees make their nests for the winter   
and dreams of bullets no longer swarm through his blood.  I hear each feather 
slice through the air like a jackknife as he hatches some new theorem  
about how to levitate above this city of churches or how to appear in the mind   
of the beholder as a porcelain crucifix that weeps tears of olive oil.  O holy father,  
he wants us to say, forgive us sinners for thinking of you  
as something less than real, a spirit that's become little more  
than the breath of your departure.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 Nothing could be further from the truth.  
This image of him laying in the coffin dressed in his best suit,   
hands folded across his stomach, the mortuary makeup tanning his skin,   
that is not reality.  Reality is the red smile of a dog bite sunk   
into a forearm, the sting of wind on cracked, bleeding lips, the upturned collar,   
the V of the throat exposed to the slow thunder of his leaving.     
Snow begins to fall as the hearse pulls away bathing the world  
in a kind of purity, each flake unique as a strand of DNA, the markers distinct,  
melting against the tongue to bestow this final gift of prophecy.

## My Father's Left Hand

turned the yellow-handled screwdriver   
to bind copper wire and receptacle together  
so electricity could flow like blood.  

It gripped the pencil that scrawled these equations  
in a black field book, longitude and latitude,  
where the plumb bob fell to earth,  

and pushed black glasses up on the bridge  
of his nose as he smiled at the lumberyard salesman  
loading southern pine 2x4s in the bed of a pickup.  

I see the outline of that hand now in mine,  
the nails pink and ridged, the fingers long   
as stems rising from thawing ground,   

how it gripped the seams of a baseball 
showing a young boy how to throw a heater  
right down the heart of the plate,  

or pushed a golf ball and tee into manicured grass,  
then locked pinky with the index finger of the other hand  
to complete the swing in one unified motion.  

But what trajectory does a life take after it is gone?  
Does it drop like a bird in mid-flight, or continue   
like a satellite broadcasting its signal through deepest space?  

These lives my own hand guides, will they ask  
the length of my lifeline, am I now at the zenith of my power,  
or just want to be comforted by my touch?  

My dad's left hand wore the gold ring that bound   
him to us, this symbol of trust, now dimming in the half-light   
of memory, where wildflowers climb a wall of chiseled letters.

## And he saw what was written there

but couldn't say it or give it a name.    
He was suffering, in despair, his mind   
shaped like a fire fueled by those words.   
His imagination burnt them to ashes,   
only to see the letters rise anew,  
flavored with wine, scrawled in cursive  
in the red lipstick of a woman's hand.  
Other times he thought he lived in a cooling galaxy  
where everything was blackness, void,  
except those words glowing like stardust,  
forming constellations, planets with atmospheres,  
life beginning to crawl out of sulfuric oceans.  
Today those words oozed with nectar,  
buzzed like a Mozart concerto played   
on the lawn after sunset, the flies swarming   
in and out of the light attracted   
to the smells of blooming carrion flowers.   
Each day they were born anew, like some laboratory   
experiment in a sci-fi movie gone wrong  
that unleashed a deadly epidemic  
without a cure.  But that first night  
in the darkness of his apartment,  
they were like a knife rushing toward him,  
the glint of silver slashing through air  
to cut the vocal chords, sever the windpipe,  
until there was nothing he could say, nothing.

## Bridges to Nowhere

For eight hours in the semi-darkness of the plane,   
the sun trying to stoke its little campfire  
bright enough to burn through the clouds,  
I stare at my face reflecting off of the window  
puffy as a beach ball left beneath a palm tree.  
Then we start the descent to Ted Stevens Airport,  
mowing our way through the greyness   
until suddenly the ocean, scaled with ice,   
appears before us flat as a school of washed-up jellyfish.  
We sink lower and lower as the hammock of air gives way  
and the wheels skid to a stop amid a world of whiteness.  
Outside the terminal, flakes fall like watermelon seeds  
diced through the blades of an electric fan.  
My Iñupiaq driver likes lemonade and The Steelers  
as he strokes his matador's braid and speaks  
with the voice of the tundra. I might as well be a dwarf fir  
shagged with one of his 18 words for snow,  
instead of just another tourist come to pan   
for technology gold with a sack full of supplies.  
Instead I look like a round-eyed seal waiting for the club to strike.  
The jawbones of whales, upright, crossed like harpoons,  
mark the entrance to this hotel built with government dollars  
in the hope others would come, step through the doors  
and hear the wolves howling over their latest kill.

## Everyone Forgets 

Hitler was also an artist.  
It's like when the most harden street thug,  
arms covered with tattoos, raps out   
the sweetest rhymes of love in the midst  
of his enemies.  You know the anger   
still exists somewhere.  Your kids turn up the volume  
on their headphones, and from the front seat you can hear   
the sound of boots marching through a bombed-out Dresden   
or the clash of knuckles against cheeks in the abandoned   
warehouses and streets of Detroit.  How can it be otherwise?  
You drive past drug dealers hanging out on the corners   
scanning for undercover cops while skinheads   
seethe across the street handing out pamphlets.    
Your kids, focused inward, fail to see the intricate   
architecture of the buildings, gargoyles and medieval daemons,   
faces that could be so easily captured in watercolors  
or surfaced with words in books or speeches.    
All they hear is the beat, the lyrics a blur of sound,  
the flash of gold teeth, skin tightening   
around bone where the ugliness incubates.  
The corpses lie in the reverb, the sampling,  
the pauses between words where silent bullets fly    
and that stray dab of paint on canvas.  
That is the door behind which all future atrocities hide.

## The Question

It is pondering the reason  
for my existence,  
that gentle corpse bird  
sitting in the tree singing  
its song all night long. 
It comes to me in the form  
of two zombies just stepped  
through the door of the grave.  
They knock and knock,  
and I hear them the way animals  
hear the earthquake coming  
hours before it arrives, that lower decibel  
beyond the human ear.  I am my own   
horror movie, not even safe in the arc  
of lamplight interrogating my hands,  
the hardpan of my face, the weeds and vines  
sprouting everywhere that speak of neglect.  
Where are the weapons?  What is the opportunity?  
I find the Bible cupped in my palm like a tomahawk,  
stained with the blood of the lamb, the words marching  
up my arms like black ants.  I thought my brain  
was a cloud on a stem dusting the highest peaks,  
releasing its burden above where men can climb.  
But it was nothing but breath, breath fogging a pane   
upon which a stick figure was drawn.  They shatter  
the glass. They break down the door, the smell  
of autopsied flesh, always needful, always longing  
for more company.  Few can recall how it happens,  
one cell at a time exploding, until there's nothing  
but light, a dirty light coming out of the eyes,  
dark rivers flowing back to the source.  
From the bottom of a well everything   
resounds, radiantly aware of its own impossibility.    
They touch me, cold as the earth they come from,   
sink their teeth into my flesh, dip their hands   
into my guts.  I'm ice listening to that damn bird sing  
it mournful song: why, why, why, why.  
I'm a glacier falling into the ocean piece by piece  
and floating away.

## Things I Didn’t Know I Loved

Unlike Nazim Hikmet, I’m not on a train to Moscow   
watching the landscape pass through my reflection   
in the window like a menagerie of memories   
parading before me in all their animal magnetism.  

I’m stuck in a cool office looking over a parking lot   
sprinkled scraps of trash and the occasional car,  
a ghost town compared to two years ago.  

And here I sit alone in my chair at a fake wooden desk   
so old school with my pencil and paper,   
creating on the bosses dime,  
the pink eraser marks like a kiss of love    
for those stillborn thoughts that couldn’t survive   
my own cruel world of make believe.    

How I cherish these remnants of what could have been,   
like children who disappeared before they emerged   
from the womb to take their names.  
  
How I love the quiet and solitude   
of an empty office building during a pandemic,  
the vacant desks strewn with the recollections   
of co-workers, everything abandoned like a ghost town   
in the disarray of the moment as work shifted to home offices.   
 
Now a reflection in a computer screen  
is a spark struck from the flint of memory,   
a conversation to be had over and over again   
as years tumbleweed through the matrix of time.  

The hum of air-conditioning through the ducts,  
a friendly conversation among colleagues, a debate  
of ideas looking for that magic potion    
of capitalistic chemistry to bring in more revenue.  

I am not alone here, though I am alone,  
even with the fields sprawling beyond the panes of glass,  
the occasional deer who creeps by looking toward  
a building, abandoned half constructed, little more than an acre   
in the distance, fox on their twilight prowls, and mice  
who sneak in through the drainage pipes at night  
to nibble any stray tidbits aging in a desk draw,  
leave their own type of poetry sprinkled    
across keyboards and notepads just waiting for our return.

## Still Life with Woodpecker

Alone  
inside four walls  
made of southern pine  
a twelve by twelve by eight box  
this diminutive universe of solitude  
without a road running past  
without any wires strung overhead  
or buried underground  
with windows that look out   
onto fir branches  
and brambles of raspberries  

Alone   
with a bowl of apples  
blushing on the table  
a battery powered radio  
the feral darkness encroaching  
like a villain ready to steal  
whatever beauty remains  
the blue cybernetic eye  
of a paperweight weighing down  
my thoughts of a past  
that may or may not have existed  

Alone   
with a rotary telephone  
plugged into nothing  
but the spirits of friends and family  
their silent voices   
on the other side whispering  
unhearable secrets  
of the burdens they bear  
from this life into next  
the graves they’ve dug  
for themselves and their loved ones  

Alone  
with so much I want to forget  
to relive differently  
as distant stars spiral into a cosmos  
of swirling nebulas on the ceiling  
these encyclopedias of images  
arriving randomly like the tap tap tap  
of a woodpecker’s beak  
against a rotten tree  
the treat always hidden from plain sight  
but unforgettable when found

## Georg Trakl

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    *I am a shadow distant from somber villages  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I drank God’s silence   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    from a fountain in the grove.*  

Never mind the deserters hanged  
like clusters of purple fruit   
outside the barn  
where you medicate dying soldiers.  

Never mind the gun ticking   
on your hip like an alarm clock.  

I come to offer you peace  
as the howitzers rumble  
like heat lightning on the horizon.  

and mustard gas liquefies  
of tomorrow’s ambulance patients.  

Already you hear their screams  
ring out like gunshots   
in your temples 
saying you can’t save them all.

You can’t save them all.

Hell, you can’t even save yourself  
with this exorcism of poems  
you labor over each night.  

Understand, I don’t care what you did  
with your sister in the curtained  
rooms and walled gardens of Salzburg.  

I don’t care what drugs  
you take to fight the shame.  

I just want a drink of Mosel wine  
to wash the road-dust from my mouth.  

I want to touch your drunken face   
one last time as we stand  
under the black oak   
that becomes your coffin.  

Wittgenstein is only three days away  
to buy you out of this god-awful army  
and still you can’t hold yourself together.  

Your hands keep bursting into flame.  

Never mind that gun strapped to your hip.  

Never mind the hanged soldiers  
creaking like bells in the wind.  

Take the dark spider of my heart,  
its white sack of poison.  

Inhale this cocaine of sleep  

so I can taste your blood forever  
in the bitter pieces of apple  
sliced by my knife.

## Doppelgänger

Craziness just oozes out  
of the jail of the mirror,  
its cruel confines.  Trapped  
there for what seems a lifetime  
his eyes burn   
through your body  
like solar flares,  
the envy, the remorse.  
Yet somehow he escapes  
to follow you like a stalker  
everywhere you go, draining  
your life-blood with his eyes,  
haunting your conversations  
with words not said,   
taunting your loved ones   
with what could have been.  
He’s armed not with bullets,  
but that powerful potion of self-doubt  
he sprinkles around rooms  
just before you enter.  
You can sense it all around,  
an intoxicating fragrance  
corroding your soul,  
twisting your tongue  
until you are speaking   
in another language   
that makes no sense to anyone.  
And all the while he is there  
pursuing you   
in every pane of glass  
with a wild-eyed grin  
saying I am that person  
you deserve to be.   
I am your destiny.

## Orphans

We lived in an abandoned house  
like freeloading mice or racoons, a stream's  
cool, mercurial waters flowing on one side,  
on the other a rough hewn civil-war-style fence,   
stained with the gunpowder of domestic conflict.
  
Here no one visited us, and no one left.    
We stole eggs from blue jays and robins,  
beans, rice, and chicken from the general store,    
scooped up roadkill in our wanderings,  
twig fire feasts spread all across the county.  
  
We were little more than abandoned   
hubcaps slowly rusting in life's brambled ditch   
on the most deserted highways to eternity. 
 
But we dreamed without sleeping,   
without waking, our bodies like spirits  
wandering through other people’s dreams,  
our invisible hands entering their flesh,   
packing their lives with existential questions  
the way a church collection plate gets filled   
on Sundays by Saturday night’s biggest sinners.
  
We failed to exist in the same way    
seeds can sleep forever encased   
beneath the tilled garden soil. Yet we were   
nothing more than a black wind wherever   
we went and people passed by, kept passing by,     
expressionless, hitching their coats   
tight around their necks,   
careful not to look up,   
even for a moment, into our eyes   
glimmering like wishing wells of silence.

## Summer at the Edge of the World

I light the candle and look at my watch.  
Four-thirty AM.  It's always four-thirty AM,  
the battery frozen in time like a sports reel.  
I see the black of the scorpion clinging   
to the stucco wall, the curve of its tail  
that questions my very existence.  
It drops into a glass whose walls  
it can't climb as it now sits on the counter,  
its legs failing to grip the smoothness.  
I step outside into the air still cool with night   
as the sun beings its steep climb on the horizon.   
Coyotes retreat up the wash to their caves  
in the mountains after a night hunting  
in single file like soldiers,  
their blood curdling screams of success  
just a memory of a dream in a distant land.  
The prickly pear sharpen their thorns  
and the saguaro lean a little taller   
into the coming heat.  I turn on the butane burner  
to brew a cup of coffee, lower the sheets   
over the windows.  The radio's batteries      
barely hold a charge, but I can hear the static  
of another world coming through,  
the faint voices of people talking  
hundreds of miles away, as though my wilderness   
world no longer existed, and their lives   
were the only things that contained meaning.  
I need to hear their voices each day to know I'm right.

## When the Skies Opened

According to mother  
her belly curled   
like an upside down question mark,  
a Spanish phrase planted in native soil,  
an interrogative clause in search of being,  
the immaculate statement of purpose  
for a fifteen year old laying on the bed sobbing  
no longer able to hide the angel inside,  
or make it disappear into the night.  
She could feel its gentle kick,  
the heartbeat like a clock    
measuring the time until arrival,  
that earthquake that would bring us  
back down into humility,  
the place where we all began. 
 
According to father  
that bastard Enrique was going to pay.    
No more sneaking around  
with every girl in the neighborhood,  
no more firefly serenades  
with wine and campfires.  
no more rides in the gansta mobile  
or flashing hand signs to his homies.  
Enrique was going to do the honorable thing,  
be a father and provider,  
give up the street corner drug deals,  
the easy hustles.  His family would not be  
so dishonored, his daughter defiled and abandoned.  
He would bring all the rain from heaven down on Enrique  
until he was trapped on a tiny island   
where he could not escape.

## Day 65 of the Quarantine

Highways bask in the afternoon heat    
ready for their carless rush hours.    
Store shelves, picked over by mid-morning,    
await the next overnight restocking.    

Those who can work do so by computers,    
video calls, instant messaging as their lives    
shrink into an apartment-size shell.    

Those who can’t await the bail-out checks,    
frittering their days away on the cliff-edge    
of insolvency as police cars and SWAT teams    
ensure the restaurants, barbershops,    
and knickknack shops stay shutdown.    

My own life fits into a cigar-box of memories--    
first steps, baby teeth, report cards,    
photographs of bike rides, swimming,     
making snowmen, weddings... all pointing     
to the uncertainty ahead     

like hair falling onto the shoulders     
under the buzz of antique clippers    
in the hands of an amateur barber,     
the curls drifting downward     
onto the deck      

only to be pushed by the wind          
toward some final, unknowable destination.

## Life’s Calendar

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Dan Cuddy*

The days go up in smoke,     
little pieces of my life     
constantly flaking off      
to stoke the fires that keep      
my world warm, vibrant.     

These ashes don’t diminish me.     
They are a mound      
upon which I grow      
into some shrinking phoenix     
forever struggling to take wing.     

I creak and groan,     
an abandoned house     
in wind and rain,     
waiting for ghost-hunters to enter      
searching for their treasures.     

But no one comes,     
so I sift through books      
under lamp light,     
replay the keystrokes of history,     
follow the Escher curve of words     

backwards and forwards     
over the scree and cinders     
of human foibles.       
No one comes so I eat take out     
from below average restaurants     

wondering why everything     
tastes the same, yet so different,     
like a dictionary of word noodles      
arranged in infinite combinations      
to give meaning to meaninglessness.     

Yet sometimes deep in the night      
I can feel my body take this nourishment      
of ashes and compost, mold it into feathers      
to glide through the air of time,     
as if my mind believes it is possible     

and can teach these wings to respond.

## Hyacinths

Death surrounds me like the fog     
of that gray, misty morning     
where raindrops pierce     
the cheeks like frozen needles     
extracting painless drops of blood.     

I am that mannequin, that statue     
carved into an heroic pose      
who can only lay still     
among the wreaths of mournful flowers     
surrounding me, the people who stop     
and stare for a minute as the words     
and a good laugh refuse to emerge      
between us like in olden times.     

I can only watch silently      
as son, wife and daughter     
stand before me, their tears      
like hushed prayers of ascension      
touching the lips of this sinner     
as I melt into a stony regret.       

I hear anguish and sorrow     
in all the voices surrounding me     
as the preacher emerges     
onto the pulpit in his robes,     
begins to speak of love,     
and what lies ahead for all,     
his words growing more distant     
as I feel the wheels rolling,     

see my brothers and uncles     
grasping the bars on each side,      
their gentle lift as someone     
places a bouquet of my wife’s     
hyacinths into my hands,      
picked fresh from the yard,     
just starting to flair into spring’s blue flames.     

And I hold them before me like a torch     
to light my way with love      
of family, friends as I step into darkness     
to begin my journey through the underworld,     
to be reborn, pure in my original sin.

## The Cubist Paints His Ideal Woman

Who needs fingers on hands,     
or eyes just below the forehead?     

The world isn’t comprehended     
through tendons, vessels or muscle contractions,     
but through the all-seeing eye of the soul.     

I close my eyes to see you more clearly,     
touch the curves of your body     
with the camel-haired brush of infinite colors     
as you take shape on the canvas,     
your skin free of clothing,     
but overflowing with passion      
in your living room’s salon of beauty.     

Your hundred fingers reach out     
to grasp my hand     
as I attempt to hold you closer     
than skin will allow     
or the mind can absorb.     

The eyes of your breasts     
reflect my image as they fill     
with tears of prideful joy.     
The twenty lips covering your body     
begin to speak in different tongues.     
I don’t dare silence them, ever.     

My love, imaginary or real,      
this is what it’s like to kiss eternity.

## Genesis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for my wife*

I, too, have lain in the chemo bed     
looking at all the concerned faces      
of doctors and nurses as if     
I were looking into my own coffin,     
their stethoscopes hanging like rosaries     
around their necks as their lips     
whispered secret prayers.     

I’ve had my very core wiped clean     
by the harshest of chemicals     
like a tree whose heartwood is suddenly     
drilled out and left to flounder     
in a sudden, severe thunderstorm,     
my lifeless limbs flaying back and forth     
beyond my control.     

I’ve been rebuilt using my own stem-cells     
surrounded by the smell of antiseptics     
in an isolation unit breathing purified air,     
hearing the voice of God in everything,     
especially my loved ones, urging me on,     
don’t give up, don’t fall for Gideon’s Apocalypse     
lurking in every drawer.  This is the time of creation.

## Words

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Homero Pumarol*

When I read my poems aloud      
before audiences or in front of video cameras      
I feel like Icarus     
flying too close to the sun      
on wings of someone else’s design     
awaiting the inevitable plummet into icy waters.     
When others read my poems      
my brain freezes. The words paralyze me     
until I become a statue     
of my own emotions      
sculpted by some abstract artist,     
an unrecognizable parody of myself.     
I want to joke to those around--      
who wrote this crap, what garbage--     
until I recognize the knife blade      
of a phrase or two     
that used to stab me      
in the heart every time I said it aloud     
like a serial killer rummaging      
through my personal effects      
in the middle of the night     
looking for any excuse to justify his actions.     
But I just order drinks,     
retreat to the men’s room,     
shine the lantern of attention elsewhere     
with bad jokes or mispronunciations.     
In the end, what can I do      
with these former selves          
who keep standing up in public      
to denounce what I’ve become--     
bury them in the cellar      
with the other dead bodies     
or keep trying to fly toward      
that most intense light      
on giant wings made of wax?

## Nice Day Today

Unshaven, the old man     
sits on a bench     
in front of his nursing home     
holding a deck of cards close to his chest,     
muttering nice day today,     
nice day.     

We pass listening to     
his unintelligible mumblings,     
the word-garble of the mind     
as he shuffles the deck,          
deals two hands,     
ignoring our watchful eyes.     

The sun is warm,     
with a light breeze keeping things temperate     
as he picks up one hand,     
arranges the cards to his liking,     
discards two only to draw again     
muttering nice day today, nice day.     

We watch from a distant doorway,     
a distant world, as he stares     
fixated on the ghosts of his gambling buddies     
while an unseen virus devastates the world      
around him, and people riot,     
loot and burn in the name of justice.     

Then waking, he calculates the odds,     
reads the bluffs, places his bets.     
There’s just the finger of God     
reaching out to touch him     
on this nice day today,     
what a nice day.

## Waiting for the Second Coming

The cattle are lowing     
but there’s no baby in the manger. Christmas day     
dawns cold and bright without a star to follow     
or Wise Men who come trudging over the whitened     

hills. All I see are the swaying backsides of Guernseys,     
tails flicking flies out of habit. They waddle     
like old ladies answering the call of church bells     
weary from lugging oversized purses     

filled with life’s necessary nothings.     
They stare in wide-eyed astonishment     
that I’ve left the warmth of the house, presents     
unopened under the tree as the others snore     

snugly in their beds. The sucking sound     
of my rubber boots in the mud draws them     
closer. I lead them one by one into the stalls,     
smear antiseptic on the udders, attach     

the metal fingers. Liquid rushes through tubing     
as the gentle massage begins and the collection tank     
fills. I listen to the whir of the vacuum motor,     
unthinkingly replace one cow with another.     

If there’s a Messiah born on this day,     
surely he would be here, nestled dryly     
in the loft, adored by his teenage parents,     
who fled their own Caesars and Herods,     

I want to rise from this damp straw     
that smells of dung, urine and sour milk     
to behold the radiance of his face,     
the peaceful reassurance that miracles await.     

But I’m afraid all I’d find is two scared children     
holding a screaming baby, the bloody     
afterbirth matted in the hay, a beat-up     
Volkswagen hidden behind a clump of evergreens,     

and their eyes begging the blessing of my silence.     
As the last udder is emptied, a halo     
of light descends from the loft window     
to circle my thorn-crowned head, and it is finished.

## No Sign of Life

the moon     
broken like a horse     
galloped riderless through the night     

I wasn’t asleep     
when it came to wake me     
its mane tickling my face     
with the fingers of a beautiful girl     
or ghost-hands of a famous painter     
who left the stars of parting on my wall     

in my dreams     
I can see bright birds of desire     
flying like geese made of quilting scraps     
black-eyed susans petaled by bumblebees     
the emerald bones of the father     
cast like dice against a crumbling stone wall     
the two-backed beast of mythology     
writhing amid the foliage     
like a bad thought in Sunday school     

but when it poked its head through my window     
I offered up my heart like an apple     
clinging to the first sucker branch of a sapling     
a perfect fit for those teeth     
that grinned like a girl floating naked on a raft

## Jim Doss is Dead

(Headline from the Daily Oklahoman circa 1900)
There is very little grieving over his death.

I died in El Reno on Vallejo’s Thursday     
on a day I can already remember     
as autumn rains dotted the Oklahoma roads     
like stray derringer shots, and I sauntered out alone,     
the rhythmic brutality of horse’s hooves     
stamping their U’s into desert floor.     

A week ago it was just another Vallejo     
from Mexico that I had in custody, a stump of a fellow     
like his famous namesake dying of hunger,     
want and lack of love, a tumbleweed     
that blew over from Texas to spread his fire     
across the badlands I marshal. Spain     
shaped his heart and mind with the blood     
of the conquistadors. The savagery of the Aztecs     
breathed in his tattoos, his greasy hair and skin,     
the primitive slope of his forehead     
that could not understand my commands.     

So I beat him with the knot-end     
of a rope, with a stick I found under a Palo Verde,     
and my fists pumping like the pistons of a train     
until I could punch no more. The only witnesses     
were the Thursdays, the bruised ribs and shoulder blades,     
the loneliness, the rain, and the roads of escape not taken.     
Then I bought his broken-tongued silence     
with a bullet in the middle of the forehead     
while he pleaded on his knees in words as foreign     
as the singing of crickets in cotton fields.     

I didn’t care what the newspapers printed     
about “the bad man from Bitter Creek”     
who could outdraw any gun in the southwest.     
I wrote my psalms in gunpowder and smoke,     
a staccato of flashes and roars     
echoing in sunlight, wind and sandstone, the desert     
yellows and reds that I color a little redder.     

Who needs all these Vallejos streaming across     
the Rio Grande, their lunch pails filled     
with an agony that searches for poetry,     
jobs and God? It was my duty to apprehend     
and enforce the law with an Old Testament     
severity that even Jehovah could admire.     
But my own words circled back     
for revenge when a bullet ripped through     
the tin lettering on my chest that read: justice served.

## Leda and the Cowboy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Luci Tapahonso*

It was the night of the steel guitars.     
Above her head the stars huddled     
in strange constellations     
shaped like fiddles and banjos.     

As she crossed the parking lot,     
a sudden gust of wind swept fingers of dirt     
over the painted lines;     
a chord sounded softly in the evening.     
Something inside of her answered.     

She pushed open the heavy wooden door     
of *The Sly Horse Saloon*, stepped     
into the neon glow of cigarette haze     
dizzy from the first few breaths.     
That’s when she saw him     
reflected in the mirror behind the bar.     

He wore a ribbon shirt     
made of buckskin,     
and stiff blue jeans tucked     
into red cowboy boots.     
White swans swam in circles     
on each leather side panel.     

She held his glance a moment too long.     

They danced all night, gliding     
like feathers over eddies of music.     
Her feet never grew tired     
as if he carried her on the wings of his voice     
whispering things she would not remember     
in the morning. His hot breath     
caressed the sourness     
of the work week from her neck.     

It was last call,     
and she had to leave     
before the lights came on.     
He led her out     
with an arm draped loosely around her waist,     
pressed her against his pickup     
as his body arched     
to ease her under the camper shell     
where a dirty mattress lay.     

Surrounded by saddles,     
tool boxes, and trash bags filled with clothes     
he made love to her slowly,     
his low moans like a base line     
keeping rhythm with her falsetto harmonies.     
When it was over     
he covered their spent bodies     
with a blanket that smelled of horses.     

From the old stains it was clear     
he’d done this before,     
sought her out over asphalt trails of moonlight     
as he would seek others out     
and couldn’t hear the raw music     
now singing in her womb.     

After giving birth to twins     
she remembered how flawlessly     
they danced that night, how she stood     
by the window for months     
pining over his scent     
that still clung to her blouse.     

When she held her babies     
to her breasts she could see horses     
running through their hair,     
wild horses that raced beneath a desert sky     
where all the constellations     
were shaped like mandolins and dulcimers     
and the rider’s lasso always fell just short.

## Cronos in the Underworld

Exiled, he sits by the fire,     
glass of Jack in hand,     
surrounded by the ticking of clocks.     

Hundreds line the walls and shelves,     
vestiges of his dead wife,     
but none carry the correct time.     

He winds them with keys     
when their springs run down,     

imagines the jaws of oblivion     
swallowing the seconds     
as if they were children     
who wanted to usurp all he has built.     

This afternoon he traveled     
the north 40 by tractor,     
snow feathering his shoulders,     
twigs of ice in his hair,     

to hear the foreman say     
in broken English: “boss,     
you have fine calving     
if warm weather ever come. I know it.”     

For hours he watched     
his cows scatter     
over the hillsides like so many dollars     
the winter gusts threatened     

to blow away, the cold strained     
to harden into butcher’s bait for the saw.     

How many real estate agents,     
Olympus cameras in hand,     
had his children brought by     

to photograph the land, pace out     
subdivided lots, calculate profit and commission,     
only to be chased-off with a shotgun?     

The yellow liquid flows     
into his veins reigniting     
the brushfires of bitterness.     

Across the open range of his mind     
the seconds sprout like new grasses     
and feed this will to live     

just one breath longer     
than the last of his offspring.

## Aphrodite

Out of the mud foaming with blood,     
past the bellows of the newly nutted steers,     
she steps, the light opening behind her     
like a giant shell to reveal blonde curls     
flowing over the shoulders of her blue bib-overalls,     
skin camellia white, checks blushed and tight     
as October tomatoes, lips sweet as clover honey.     

He watches her sway     
towards him through waves of heat,     
a pail of yellow grain in her hand, followed     
by chickens and pigs. She sings     
a song to herself from the hills     
about the forbidden love of a moonshiner’s daughter     
as she climbs a fence of shiny barbed wire.     

When they kiss he has visions     
of earth twisting green tendrils     
though his veins, vines blossoming with fruit     
from every joint in his body. Hands that planed wood     
only hours before shape her waist, the curve of her breast     
while the knives of her father and brother flash     
their warnings in the sunlight.

## Cassandra

foresaw it all, the doom and disasters,     
the follies and the hubris, as she walked past     
the post-modern curves of the Watergate,     
or beneath the shadow of the Capital Dome,     
or the sweeping cross of the National Cathedral spire.     

She couldn’t keep quiet. Scenes     
strobed through her mind: guns, needles,     
cylinders of plutonium, hooded figures     
walking labyrinths of razor wire,     
airplanes sleek as missiles drawn     
in desert sand. Whether she crouched     
in cardboard-city alleyways beneath the rust     
of metal fire escapes, stretched out     
on the sweat-soaked beds of the shelters,     
or slipped into the boiler room     
of a neighborhood church if the janitor     
left the rear door unlocked, the oracle     
burned inside her like a molten diamond     
twisting on a chain, casting its various shades     
and hues against the concave mirror of her eye.     

At sunrise I’d sometimes see her, shuffling     
along in shoes 3 sizes too big, laceless,     
the eyelets mimicking the brown circles     
around her vacant sockets as her white tube     
socks drifted aimlessly between knee and ankle,     
and her print dress flapped in the wind     
like a sheet pinned to a clothesline.     
Some days she’d stand on a cement flower box,     
raise herself several feet above the heads     
of the commuters as they headed to the subway     
holding up a cardboard sign with a single word     
colored with grade school crayons. Other days     
she’d pose motionless like a classical figure     
carved in marble waiting for the onslaught     
of the barbarians, or she’d rage with all the sulfur     
of hell’s furies like a televangelist speaking     
in tongues no one could understand.     

Occasionally someone might slip her     
a dollar, whisper a name, show a picture,     
listen as the images spilled forth,     
jagged shards of an assembling mosaic     
excavated from the Pompeii of their lives.     
But most just scuffed by, heads down-turned,     
wool caps pulled over their ears.     
They’d only pay attention to those gods     
with snakes in their hair or arrows in their quivers,     
not some goat-legged old woman on the verge     
of being swept away by the wind     
who could divine where their next step     
might lead, then the next, and the next.

## Ghazal of the Chimera

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*She was of divine race, not of men, in the fore part a lion,     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the hinder a serpent, and in the middle a goat, breathing     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth in terrible manner the force of blazing fire. And slew her,     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trusting the signs of the gods.     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Homer, The Iliad*     

The beast appeared to you in the form of voices,     
three separate heads that spoke in children’s voices.     

They haunted your sleeping and waking, taunted     
you into catatonic trances with their siren voices.     

Your psychiatrist diagnosed it as repressed sexual guilt,     
prescribed heavy medication to deaden the voices.     

Your priest said the devil inhabited your soul,     
offered to perform an exorcism to free you from the voices.     

But the heads of the beast said: no, listen to us, not them,     
we are your guides, follow the instructions of our voices.     

The beast grew stronger, larger as each day’s pills     
were skipped, communions missed. A trinity of voices     

echoed through your brain. You covered your ears     
with pillows, banged your head with a book. Your own voice,     

a pebble standing against the flood. Gun, knife, mother, father,     
were you the only hero left who could rise up to slay these voices?

## Prometheus

Warm nights found him seated     
on the hood of a Barracuda     
behind Pearson’s Drugs, the red coal     
of his cigarette scribing secrets in the darkness.     

To the boys gathered round, he sermonized     
about his favorite bands, the best football teams,     
how to steal without getting caught     
or cop a feel from the prettiest girls.     

He fired up his 8-track just to prove a point,     
pulled out the latest Playboy,     
ogled this month’s centerfold beneath     
the car’s overhead light, described     
her attributes in glorious detail.     

They listened in rapt silence as he offered     
each a coffin nail, menthol Kool or filterless Camel,     
pinched from who knows where. He laughed     
at their coughing jags when they tried to inhale     
as deeply as him, called them newbies or rubes,     
though he was only a year older.     

When his tobacco ran out,     
he’d slip into the store, palm a few packs     
into his pocket, slide a box of rubbers up his sleeve,     
tell them these were his gifts to humanity     
as he exited, triumphantly flashing his spoils.     

Brass balls, he called it. But the night the cops     
showed up in a swirl of red and blue,     
they slammed his head against the hood of the cruiser,     
confiscated his paraphernalia, a trunk full of stolen goods.     

Rumor had it he was headed for juvie,     
but no one saw him again. They     
remembered his face illuminated in match-light,     
long hair framing a patchwork beard,     
features only a mother could hang halo or horns on.

## Sisyphus in Descent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*One must imagine Sisyphus happy.     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Albert Camus*     

Sentences flowed so easily,     
poem after poem, story after story     
as he pushed the boulder to the top     
of the mountain, watched it roll down again,     
turn into another blank piece of paper     
laying on his desk hungry for words.     

He loved to feel the pen’s pressure     
on the calluses of his hand     
as he crafted the shape and texture     
of the next boulder, braced his shoulder     
against the stone to push its heft     
upward, defy gravity and inertia.     

Now silence consumes his days     
in wads of paper that pile up     
around his trashcan like pebbles of frustration.     

What he wouldn’t give to embrace     
the boulder’s rough contours once more,     
touch the igneous of creation     
still smoldering inside its granite heart     
as his body strains with joy to climb     
into the star-filled night.

## Cain and Abel

As I step from the doorway he is there,     
mid-summer tan at the start of spring,     
hair and beard black as night in the trees.     

Like a specter he hovers by a trashcan     
showing me his chewed-off hands. Blood     
runs from the corners of his mouth.     

He does not know what is real and what     
isn’t. Or if the stumps he waves at me     
and the other passersby have fingers,     

tendons, and bones, can grasp and reach,     
and raise food to his mouth. And I do not know     
if he is real or imagined, or if he understands     

the harm he has inflicted on himself.     
In ignorance the voices descend upon him     
like crows to peck out his eyes, to drink up     

the puddles of his ears, to sit on his shoulders     
and screech in the language of angels and daemons.     
His own voice cannot talk over them no matter     

how fast the incantations roll off his lips,     
how loudly his words rise to roost on rooftops     
to join the chorus that mocks him. I can’t see     

the shower of agony that descends to claw     
his consciousness. I can’t lift the pain     
that covers his creation like a blood-stained rock.     

When did he cleave from me? From which     
rib was he formed with dust and spit?     
Did the same hand that made me make him?     

He is eating in the morning light, eating     
whatever he has found, or eating himself     
and the landscape around him. I am supposed     

to watch his every move with no looking away     
in revulsion. I am to absorb every detail     
in the cliff of his face, every expression     

that rises and falls in the back drafts,     
every hawk of emotion that soars, disappears.     
Inside this cathedral of air that separates us     

is a paradise we both inhabit like planets     
spinning around separate suns, each     
with their own life forms and civilizations.     

Not the paradise of the first man,     
but the last where we must again learn     
how to take comfort from one another.

## Ritalin Dreams

his mouth is a starfish     
that crawls across     
unmapped ocean floors     

searching for words to eat     
words to regurgitate     
to satisfy the silence     

any word to stop the lap     
of waves against     
the casing of his brain     

chairs float by     
couches drag their legs     
across his back     

baseballs footballs     
electronic gadgets     
and still he wants to fly     

but I have no wings to give     
only ballast only buoyancy     
held by a tide of heavenly bodies     

moon-bright sun-bright     
shining above him like pills     
falling through a glass of water

## Toward the Salvation of Many

Easiest to remain     
a blank slate,     

a chalkboard     
others can use     
to draw out     
stick-figure dramas,     

write words     
and labels     
in their anger     
and joy.     

Things that can be     
rubbed off     
at the end     
of the day,     
the end of a life     

to restore     
the essential     
purity     
of being.

## Oysters

Months that end in ‘r’     
bring the bounty of the Chesapeake     
to my table. Iced in tin buckets,     

these buds of ocean rock     
hide a kernel of life     
within their fortress     

of constriction.     
Their ugliness is enough     
to make any predator     

swim away in apathy.     
But I am like the dog     
who thinks of nothing but food     

and love, whose big, sad eyes     
watch for hours     
as I pry with the knife     

in this act of self-indulgence     
to keep the taste of sea     
in my mouth, the smell of sex     

scenting my lips and fingers     
as playfully I tease     
their living bodies inside me.     

Just like my women,     
I prefer them with a little lemon     
and a lot of Tabasco     

so that life and death     
and rebirth are always on the tongue     
flavoring my words.

## Moth

I, too, would fly     
into the candle flame     
if I had wing enough to lift     
my tired body from this page.     

But only my shadow moves     
in flight across these walls     
untouched by the buzz of electricity,     
or by this or last century.     

It rises and falls     
like a graven image     
as I move my arms, stand     
or pace about tugging at my hair.     

Where is the purity     
that should emanate     
from my body in warmth, wisdom,     
and oneness with the flame?     

I cast only darkness     
wherever I go, pressed     
against the pane     
with wings spread.     

Light is rescue; light is truth     
that consumes; light is gravity     
that pulls me toward this corridor     
leading to another world     

where everything is timeless,     
without wick or shadow.

## My Crimes Are Many, the Verdicts Few

If none of the passersby comment     
on the vandalism of my hand leaning against this building,     
the assault of eyes watching their movements,     
the larceny of each breath I take from someone more worthy     
how will I know I am still me?     

I smoke to become the smoke,     
inhale the blueness inside my lungs,     
let it lift my body with its nooses of O’s     
and carry me over the city of Bethlehem     
past the Dinner Bell sausage plant,     
the car lots full of Japanese imports,     
the mill’s empty stacks pointed like artillery at the sky.     

But my desire is to settle into the trees,     
onto doorknobs, lawn furniture,     
sidewalks, anything people touch without thinking.     

I mention these thoughts     
to the guardian of my nonexistence.     
She sits cross-legged on a tan couch     
knitting the scroll of my crimes others call a scarf.     

It’s her Christmas gift to me,     
striped with a hundred shades of violence,     
but still not strong enough for the hangman.

## The Little Things

1.

“Pay attention     
to everything you’ve been told to ignore,”     
a wino once said to me.     

He sat on the cold sidewalk     
outside the train station     
jingling a cup,     

trying a different angle     
with his panhandling.     

2.

I tossed him a quarter,     
down payment toward his next bottle     
of Thunderbird or Nyquil,     

heard him mutter “big spender”     
as I walked away.     

His words echoed in my head     
the same way my footsteps     
echoed through the subway tunnel     

growing louder the deeper I descended.     

3.

In the tunnel     
the wind     
from the train     

arrives     
before the train     
itself.     

The train     
is a piston     
pushing     

a warning     
of air before it     
that parts our hair,     

tumbles stray     
pieces of trash     
along the tracks.     

This train     
is a vacuum     
that sucks all     

the loose debris     
behind it,     
a world of dust     

we either fight     
to keep from joining     
or give into.     

4.

The man seated beside me     
kept muttering to himself.     

Incomprehensible words.     
Incantations to no one.     

And for the first time I saw this man     
who’d just spoken, who’d been sitting     
next to me on the subway     
in smelly clothes     
for the past three years.     

All I could do was turn my nose,     
my eyes away from the stench,     
offended to be here,     

trapped inside this cramped space,     

not unlike the faces I see now     
folded behind the privacy     
of a newspaper.     

Even when the subway train     
did its abrupt     
snake-like rise from the ground     

to fill with sunlight     
and everyone suddenly became visible     
to everyone else,     

we still remained invisible     
to each other     

as if our bodies were dirty windows     
that no light could penetrate     
in either direction,     

as if we wore a suit of mirrors     
that reflected inward,     
showed each other nothing     

but the grey backing.     

5.

That night I lost myself     
in making love to my wife     
and fell back so exhausted     

that I was asleep     
before my head hit the pillow.     

I dreamed crazy dreams.     

I dreamed I stole a car     
and drove mile after mile     
to where the sky was free     
of high rises and airplanes.     

I drove past mountains     
and taller mountains     
until I descended into a desert,     

red rock cliffs tight     
on either side as I inched     
the car down the crushed gravel road     

around blind turns,     
steep descents and rises.     

I stopped before a stone     
that lay in the middle of the road.     
I couldn’t pass, I couldn’t go back.     

Here it was, the keystone     
to the cipher of my life,     
the answer to unlock the riddle     
curled up like a cat     
in the middle of the road.     

It cast enough shadow     
to keep more than hope alive     
in this place where everything was dying.     

Beneath it I thought     
our missing God slept     
waiting to make a return.     

But when I rolled the stone over,     
I found a pair of footprints     
dark as coal etched into the bedrock,     

human footprints from yesterday     
or eons ago, primordial,     
damp with the last rain that fell.     

They began to walk, turning east,     
and I followed over mountains,     
through rivers and fields,     
down interstates     

until I came to my front door,     
slipped into bed     
beside a beautiful woman.     

She never once asked me how I got here     
or where I was going next     

or whose footprints I put on each morning     
when I rose from bed to turn off the alarm,     
wake the kids.

## The Crazy Men Poems

*1 War of the Worlds*

Each morning he comes     
in for the free cup of coffee     
the owner generously offers,     

a purple bicycle helmet     
on his head lined     
with tin foil to block     
the signals     
of the mother ship     
he says hovers just outside     
of radar range.     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plan,     
simple— beam him up     
each night, use his seed     
to create a new master race.     

Extraterrestrial amazons     
eight feet tall await, vessels     
of passion that glow like light bulbs     
wrapped in silver.     

But he’s too smart.     
He sips his caffeine beneath     
a crucifix tacked to the wall     

through which God     
whispers only to him     
the secrets     
of how to outwit them.     

*2 The Barber of Seville*

Power-lunchers     
hit the sidewalks.     
Skyscrapers     
empty out     
like water draining down a straw.          
Thousands of people     
line each side of the street     
when he stops his car     
in the middle of the intersection,     
steps out completely nude     
and begins his solo before the crowds.     

A hairy aria fills     
the amphitheater of concrete,     
Figaro without a fig leaf     
spreading his love     
amid adoring fans.     
They gather around him     
in tighter and tighter circles     
like cuffs on his wrists     
until he is triumphantly     
escorted away by men in blue     
in a procession of flashing lights     
toward some obscure five-star hotel     
where the opera will continue.     

3 Gabriel

Each day he stands on the corner     
of New York Avenue     
in heat or cold     
watching the traffic,     
the faces     
of the commuters coming     
in and out of Washington. How     
they break     
in slow     
motion like glass,     
the rock at the moment of impact,     
shards     
collecting all their sorrow into hives     
around their eyes as they wait     
for the light to change.     

He’s here to harvest their illnesses     
a little at a time, burn     
the sickness up     
in his body that is made     
of so much light     
the human eye can’t see it.     

Invisible, he waves     
a branch of leaves     
over each car, chants     
his songs of praise to the Almighty     
for being allowed to mend     
these broken people     
with his gift of vision.     

*4 Adam*

He falls asleep     
in the rain,     
dreams     

of rain falling     
all around him     
like goldfish     
from the sky.     

Orange fins slip     
into his body,     
orange lips     
kiss the flesh away     

until nothing     
but water remains.          
He wakes     
to a clear sky’s     
reflection     
covering his body,     

feels tremors          
deep inside     
rise into volcanoes,     
dry ground,     
the first footprints.     

A lone bird          
in the trees calls out     
for him to stand up.     

And he does.

## Ecce Homo: Wie man wird, was man ist

*Friedrich, I do not hate you,     
or your fear of becoming holy.*     

Why are you here?     

*No true god would allow themselves to be crucified     
when they could goosestep through all of eternity.     
That much we can agree on.*     

Yes, but why are you here?     

*To tell you you’re the alpha and omega,     
the final solution.*     

*But you tremble, what are you afraid of?*     

Only my own shadow     
moving like a scythe across the plains     
where the armies meet.     

*What do you hear?*     

Only the wind passing through my lungs     
with the rhythm of the sea     
as the prows of warships slice through the waves.     

*What do you taste?*     

My own blood and the blood of millions     
dying from pestilence, starvation and war.     

*Do you recognize me?*     

I am a prophesy unto myself,     
the übermensch scaling the rarest heights,     
breathing the rarest air.     

*Have you seen me before?*     

No, you are a stranger to me,     
like dishwater thrown out by the maid,     
table scraps tossed to the pigs.     

*Do you know my touch?*     

How can the stars know     
the swirl of blackest space around them     
when they shine so bright?     
     
*I am your vacant-eyed destiny,     
the peace you seek     
slowly covering you like ivy     
until there is nothing left,*     

*nothing but the singularity of your mind.*

## Drawing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*For M. C. Escher*

I bend over my love     
with a pencil pressed     
against her breast.     

My lips     
just above her shoulder,     
as she bends over me     
sketching my ribs,     
the curve of my chest.     

I love to watch her eyes     
follow my hand     
as it brings her body     
slowly into focus.     

I love the way her hair     
falls across a neck     
just beginning     
to take shape.     

If you look closely     
every house we’ll     
ever live in appears     
in our faces, the windows     
left open     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to let in the day.

## The God of Aluminum that Whispers of Home

I remember Juan Valdez smiling     
across the TV channels years ago     
as he and his burro labored to bring     
the riches of Colombia to the capitalists     
of North America and Europe.     

I’m sure the words “exploitation”     
and “revolution” never crossed his lips     
as he pandered for governments     
and multinational corporations,     
just some hack actor making union     
wage, unwittingly paving the way     
for Starbucks and Seattle’s Best.     

The smell of coffee fills the terminal     
at La Guardia, triggers these strange     
thoughts inside my head as I walk toward     
my gate after proving I carry no explosives     
other than my tongue and brain.     

The 4 am risers, done with their sales calls,     
line up for a mid-afternoon jolt     
like addicts in front of a methadone     
clinic. Others lounge in black leather     
chairs with coin slots for massages     
as Rasta shoe-shine boys in knitted caps     
the color of parrots to hold their dreads     
buff a shine back into scarred leather.     

I wait for my flight’s announcement     
like Che Guevara in the mountains of South America,     
his head held over a bowl of steaming coffee     
to relieve the wheeze of asthma     
as he scribbles his revolutionary diaries,     
but this pen is the only stick of dynamite I will ever own.

## Reconstruction

All it takes is your five-year-old daughter     
in a yellow sundress     
drawing with crayons     

in a school notebook     
entitled *A Short History of My Life*     
for it to hit you.     

Suddenly you want     
to redesign the house     
over again with gables,     

plow under the overgrown hillside     
and plant it with bee balm     
and butterfly bush,     

weed everything     
out of your life     
until that one flower remains     

you will spend     
a lifetime     
nurturing as it grows     

to fill all the rooms     
you could possibly     
build.

## Ghazal of the Introvert

The ancients said we are born with only one song inside,     
then spend a lifetime trying to perfect how to out what’s inside.     

Autism is an abnormal absorption with the self,     
an inability to communicate, break free from the prison inside.     

Solopcism is the belief nothing exists beyond one’s experiences—     
people, objects are merely a mental extension of one’s insides.     

But when a rock strikes me in the head, how can it be     
an imaginary event when blood streams from my insides?     

My wife expresses anger at my non-anger, tells me I need     
to stop keeping all my frustrations locked inside.     

I walk through stands of oak, sumac, head-bowed,     
absorbed in thought, trying to get in touch with my insides.     

At parties I shy away from contact and small-talk,     
speak only to close friends, share little of what’s inside.     

Yet in my writing, I am a tiger stalking the innocent emotion,     
claws bared, ready to spend a lifetime exposing what’s inside.

## Ghazal of Assateague Island

The gentle curve of the beach along the Atlantic ocean,     
constantly reshaped by the wind and waves of the ocean.     

Wild ponies browse on marsh grasses, wax myrtle,     
groundsel, their bellies swollen like waves from the ocean.     

Nearby fishermen kneel in the sand to dig mole crabs,     
use them to bait hooks to cast their prayers into the ocean.     

Pirate Bill Wilson, his mistress claimed, hid ten chests     
of gold on the island before he was hanged across the ocean.     

Spanish galleons sunk offshore with treasure and crew,     
trinkets washed up by the constant churn of the ocean.     

Dead end roads of splintered macadam ripple over rolling dunes,     
houses wiped out when the storm of ’62 blew in from the ocean.     

In summer the tourists pitch their umbrellas in the sand,     
lather up with sunscreen, frolic in the joys of the ocean.     

When they depart, the souls of those lost here wander the beaches,     
searching for what was taken from them by the ocean.

## La Dolce Vita

I’m living deeply now     
like the earthworm, that patient farmer     
who tills the soil into bloom.     

Yet who really respects him? And does he care?     

Roots leak through the roof of his house,     
his floor is cobbled with stone     
and he speaks in mouthfuls of dirt.     

All his waking hours are spent     
in the workshop carving doorways,     
channels that lead through his kingdom of loam.     

No north star guides his eternal nights.     
He navigates on feel alone.     

But he’s always there when I spade open     
the garden in spring, pink as a cherry blossom,     
kissing the ground like some old Italian winemaker     
still anxious to savor all life has to offer.

## Black Gold

In Dubai in March it’s ninety degrees in the shade.     
But inside the Mall of the Emirates     
snow blowers are hard at work. They churn water     
into a banquet of cold spread over a white tablecloth.     
Goat cheese, dates, pomegranates, braised lamb     
touch the tongues of sheiks. Their daughters dance     
the seven veils down slopes whiter than beach sand,     
softer than a camel’s underbelly or the seat-leather of a Mercedes.     
Their sons wield Scimitar swords, charge across lunar deserts     
to welcome infidels and crusaders with the crescent moon     
of their smiles. They ride the pale stallion of gravity     
to the walls of the city, rise like clouds back into the mountains     
only to descend blizzard covered hills of manufactured metal again.     
From the Riviera of Arabia frolicking teenagers clown     

before the TV cameras, make snow angels, hurl snow balls,     
plaster each other’s faces with snow pies.     
And in the gritty flurries of Baltimore I feed the nozzle     
to my thirsty car, hear the chuckle of snow bunnies     
cloaked in tarhas teasing me from distant slopes to join in.

## Cords

The *whack* of the axe splitting wood—     
same sound my typewriter keys made     
years ago hitting #11 bond,     
a memory faded like carbon paper, but not gone.     

I resurrect it now with the roundhouse swing,     
the grand gesture of metal driving through     
seemingly impenetrable objects as a winter alphabet     
of As, Vs and Os spills about my feet.     

Bookended between tree trunks,     
they’re home now to spiders, lizards, and hornets     
that buzz through the humidity of sap-water’s     
release as the butt ends grey into a raised braille     

for the fingers to read, the arms to sort     
into bundles, and carry to the black slate hearth.     
There they’ll be stacked into words     
read by orange tongues of flame,     

poems, novels and short stories     
on the history of smoke, the chronicles of ash,     
these tales of warmth that linger long after     
the head-high pile dwindles to make room for next year.     

## Who Burns

Nudge your toe up to     
the foul line as if it were the ledge     
of a hundred story building.     

But don’t look down. Keep your eyes focused     
on the back of the rim, its ring of iron,     
feminine, open, waiting.     

Spin the ball casually in your hands.     
Feel the leather’s grain     
against your fingertips, the trademark     

burned into the hide. Dribble     
until a kind of rhythm     
starts to flow through your body.     

This could be the earth     
balanced now in your palm,     
all of its people, home, your loved ones.     

So when your knees flex     
and the arm starts its upward thrust,     
it isn’t just a ball spinning     

in this arc of Newtonian flight,     
but the expectations     
of an entire planet.     

Repeat this ritual 200 times a day     
as though each shot is     
your one and only chance at redemption.

## Iraq

Shaped like a drop of oil spilled in the driveway     
and tread into rainbow by someone’s     
Redwing boot sole, the map printed off the internet     

and scotch-taped to my son’s wall glows     
with its pastel greens, yellows, and oranges     
below a World of Warcraft poster. I watch his fingers     

dance over the keyboard as his character     
runs through the hills of Azeroth wielding     
a battle ax, tossing bombs from his belt,     

the cloak of invisibility draped over his shoulder.     
None of the “shock and awe” we saw on TV as smart bombs     
lit up the night sky like fireworks, or the bravado     

of self-congratulatory politicians. He charts the advance     
of troops in history class, colors the areas of resistance,     
catalogs Saddam’s statues falling in Baghdad     

and adds up the death counts. Then he comes home     
to practice guerilla warfare on his quests,     
alone or with the guild, tribal battles for control     

of territory, money, power, and magic,     
the revenge of a son for his father’s shortcomings.     
When I hear the scream come from his room     

that he’s died and lost everything, I don’t explain     
the concept of hubris, but let him ruminate over the oracle     
of the monitor light. There’s always the next life to get things right,     

correct mistakes, battle daemons that rise from graves.     
The numbers of the dead keep climbing as he leaps off a cliff,     
lands on his feet, slashes the throat of the next monster.

## And he saw what was written there

but couldn’t say it or give it a name.     
He was suffering, in despair, his mind     
a fire fueled by those words.     
His imagination burnt them to ashes,     
only to see the letters rise anew,     
flavored with wine, scrawled in a woman’s cursive.     
Other times he thought he lived in a cooling galaxy     
where everything was blackness, void,     
except those words glowing like stardust,     
forming constellations, planets with atmospheres,     
life beginning to crawl out of sulfuric oceans.     
Today those words oozed with nectar,     
buzzed like a Mozart concerto played     
on the lawn after sunset, the flies swarming     
in and out of the light attracted     
to the smells of blooming carrion flowers.     
Each day they were born anew,     
like some sci-fi experiment gone wrong.     
But that first night in the darkness of his apartment,     
they were like a knife rushing toward him,     
the glint of silver slashing through air     
to cut the vocal chords, sever the windpipe,     
until there was nothing he could say, nothing.

## Impressionism

clouds hang low     
over the city     
weighed down by the burden     
of untold centuries     

all roads lead     
to and from the factories     

rain falls grey on the pavement     

the ocean rolls steel-colored     
onto the pebbled shore     
where the dinghies     
lay overturned     

then from the drabness     
your children step forward     

one in vibrant orange     
the other in cheerful yellow     
beside the pond     
with its blooming water lilies

## The Love Song of J. Santiago Krebs

I did it to set her free.     

That day the air rippled like silk     
against my skin.     
The clouds unfolded     
into a grey staircase     
that invited angels to ascend.     

But a stranger appeared in the doorway     
to tell me it was impossible     
before he flew off like a bird.     

I did it because her scent     
settled into my pores, her taste     
blossomed in my mouth,     
her skin opened to my touch.     

Her eyes reaffirmed     
our silent vow as glances met     
across the parking lot asphalt,     
on the dance floor, over the smoky     
haze of the bar lights,     
or in the mirror’s reflection.     

I would do it again     
at morning’s first light, in the heat of evening,     
or in mid-day’s burning brightness.     

I set the stereo music to play     
softly in the background     
while the trees swayed     
all around my thoughts of her     
as I entered the workshop.     

I did it because her image     
appeared before me wherever I looked,     
even on this rough slab of stone.     

I did it because the chisel     
was my way of helping     
release her from the marble.

## Your Dream of Deliverance

The only window within view is nothing     
more than a porthole. Round or hexagonal.     
You can’t tell. But through the panes     
you see waves that kaleidoscope     
into icebergs then geometric flowers,     
and back again. You remember a toy     
from your childhood that got taken away.     
The spankings for disobedience     
as the room pitches back and forth.     
You doubt you’re on the Titanic or Noah’s ark     
because there’s no ticket stub     
in your pocket and no voice spoke     
a blueprint to you from the clouds.     

Your wrist is handcuffed to a steam pipe     
that runs along the ceiling. From     
the neck down you’re dressed     
in a gorilla suit, your extremities bared.     
Every part of your body     
you can’t reach itches like a match     
hungering for an emery board.     
Cold ocean water laps against your feet,     
rises up to your shins, your hips, as girls     
in ballroom gowns rush past ignoring your cries.     
Your voice must be tuned at too high     
a frequency, your pleas emitted at decibels     
beyond what the human ear can hear.     
You refuse to believe     
even debutantes could be this calloused.     

As the water approaches eye-level     
an ant clinging to a dust ball paddles over     
and winks at you. On all fours you follow     
churning legs through tunnels of dirt.     
Miles of tunnels squeeze     
your hips and shoulders. Stray roots     
scrape your face. A worm ducks     
out of the way. Panting, you struggle     
to keep up with the relentless pace.     
Just as you think these tunnels     
will never end, you tumble     
into a large chamber. Flakes of honey     
bagged like gold coins surround you.     
Further ahead, white clusters of eggs     
hang from the ceiling.     

The queen appears out of nowhere     
with a ridiculous crown on her head,     
her pincers, stilettos flashing in torchlight.     
“Where’s the fool,” she says     
as her captain nudges me forward. “Ah,     
looks like he’ll be a tasty morsel     
once he finishes the job.     
Now show him what to do. I’m hungry.”     

The bars of your cell are made of iron,     
old-fashioned black iron. The deputy’s     
boots have holes in their soles.     
He snoozes, feet propped up on his desk,     
hands firmly clutched around the keys,     
waiting for high noon. Through the window     
you see crowds gathering around the gallows.     
As the clock chimes your jail door swings open.     
A man with a hood clutches your arm,     
walks you up the wooden stairs to the cheers     
of the people below. They throw rotten     
fruit, jeer at your gestures.     

Your exploits are legend in three territories,     
illegal in all. The noose slides     
over your neck, snug as a gun belt     
around a farmer’s waist. The trap door     
releases. You fall for what seems hours,     
waiting for the fatal jerk, the last breath,     
your tongue purple, distended,     
tolling like a bell in your mouth.     
But as the rope tightens,     
you turn into a speck of dust drifting     
downward toward the dirt, a tumbleweed     
blowing across empty miles of desert,     
a mustang galloping along ridges     
of thunder, your hair filled with lightning.

## Your Dream of Fame

The pub sign is written in a language     
you can’t understand. Gothic lettering.     
The handpainted picture of a Prussian officer,     
military mustache, superior air. You step     
inside; there’s no electricity. Just a candle     
on each table, more ensconced along the walls.     
You see specters dancing on the wallpaper,     
fauns and satyrs in bacchanalian revels     
as the patrons sit solemnly in their chairs.     

Their steins are filled with wine. Blood red,     
it stains their lips and teeth.     
They snarl as you walk by looking     
for a friendly place to sit. You find     
an empty seat in the far corner. An arm slips     
a full stein in front of you without taking     
your order. From the shadows Trakl     
leans forward, angular face, sunken eyes,     
Satan one moment, Gabriel the next.     

His voice, soft as a flutter of wings,     
barely rises above guitar and fiddle.     
He calls you stranger and friend,     
though you hardly know him.     
A Lieutenant’s insignia splashes     
the high collar of his military jacket.     
He offers you an opium-dipped cigarette.     
The iciness of his fingers     
penetrates your chest and forehead.     
You shiver though the place is stifling.     
With each puff the room gets rounder, more egg-like.     

He rambles on about spit, the barracks floor,     
a reprimand, what Rimbaud or Baudelaire might have done.     
The steins keep coming, the cigarettes.     
The room becomes a perfect circle     
that bursts into dark woods.     
You wander into the night following     
a white figure before you     
who suddenly takes wing and disappears.     

You slump down in dry leaves.     
From a canopy of bare limbs,     
bells of dew ring to kiss your sleeping     
eyes open. You step through the door     
of the rising sun onto the ramparts     
of Duino Castle. Rilke, dandified, perfumed,     
hands you a cigarette. Below cliffs that da Vinci     
might have painted, the Adriatic     
glimmers blue as cobalt. You can barely distinguish     
sky from sea. His eyes peer through you,     
the irises like metal filings shifting     
around the poles of a magnet. His hand grips     
your hand like a piece of seaweed     
hauled in from the deep. His body     
is so frail and weightless it wants     
to fly away on the sails of his mustache.     

But it’s words he casts to the wind.     
Sheaves of paper covered in black ink. Like gulls     
they soar over the breakers, call out     
as they migrate to distant lands.     
Speechless you watch them float     
over the horizon as he hurriedly jots     
down more notes and releases the next page.     
When he runs out of ink, he dips     
the pen into your body. No pain, just a lightheadedness.     
A thirst to get back what you are losing.     
The blue sky, blue sea whirl into one.     

You fall, only to rise again     
in a green pond near the churning feet     
of wild swans. Lissadell’s Georgian windows     
gleam like the eyes of a spider. You step on     
to dry land, brush the algae     
off of your collar. Two girls in silk kimonos     
dance before you, one a deer,     
the other an otter. Yeats, seated under the trees,     
motions you over. He talks first     
of revolution, the Easter Rising, Parnell.     
A united Ireland. His right fist molded into a grenade,     
the left cocked like a pistol.     

Then he accuses you of being lukewarm.     
About politics, life, and art. Even utopian.     
His silver hair flashes like the tuft     
of an eagle. An aquiline nose slices you     
with a raptor’s beak. In his presence     
you are nothing more than a gaunt skeleton,     
a man of straw whose clothes flap     
in the wind, scaring nothing and no one.     

The two young girls, both beautiful,     
dance to the cadence of his voice,     
one a bear, the other a lion, as autumn braids     
their hair with the last of its wild blooms.     
From the heartwood, shadows of ancient heroes     
emerge in a conflagration of swords,     
unpardoned and uncompromised.     
In the gathering dark, he strikes a match and blows.

## The Wind-Bride Speaks

I had my reasons. And no,     
it wasn’t the chemo that made me     
crazy. It was just the day, the hour,     
the sun braiding their manes with its long fingers.     

I stopped the car by the side of road,     
hopped the fence, coaxed one over     
with a half-eaten apple. His teeth shone     
milk-white. I jumped him bareback,     
slipped the scarf into my pocket,     

rode hard into the wind. I imagined     
my long red hair streamed behind me again,     
a veil that covered the ground, not in clumps,     
but like a vine that grew everywhere     
and couldn’t be killed by the harshest chemicals.     

For a while I was in love once more,     
with myself, with life, the wind. It doesn’t matter     
how things ended. At least the police officer and the horse     
knew what these bruises were worth.

## After Making Love Othello Paints the Virgin Mary

Night swirls around me dark as witches’ tea.     
I take the brush into my hand and conjure     
from the blackness of my soul this image     
of perfection so contrary to my nature: Desdemona,     

I have deflowered you again. But my brush strokes     
conceal the sheen of our love making     
as the shape of the Virgin slowly emerges     
on canvas with your eyes, the curve of your lips.     

If you ask me the color of jealousy, it is white,     
white as the pillows used to position     
the lovers’ bodies for ecstasy     
or stop the breath in dead whisper.     

Are there betrayals beyond forgiveness?     
I would paint them white also—in the faces     
of bats hanging from crippled olive trees     
ready to awaken blackest night.

## Postcard to Vincent from Bora Bora

Dear Vincent,     

Here my eyes have regained their sight.     

Whenever I want blue, I dip my brush     
into sky or ocean; green, I touch palm fronds,     
lizards, vines, and mist-draped mountains;     
red, I taste passion fruit, drink rain water     
trapped inside orchid petals,     
sample honey on the tip of hummingbird wings;     
brown, I walk the beaches,     
watch the natives swimming, steal what few     
clothes they wear out of the trees,     
bowl coconuts over smooth sand.     

Every day is like a card game of joker’s wild,     
with me as joker, unlike our tense,     
rough-knuckled days and nights in Arles,     
painting in the sun-stroked fields,     
drinking absinthe in the cafés,     
blinded by rage, jealousy and flying fists.     

Forget that nasty business with your ear.     
It will heal. Living here I’ve realized     
love is not meant for prudes.     
Stop listening to all those shriveled     
raisins in the Amsterdam pulpits.     

Though we’re half a world apart,     
it’s time to bury the hatchet,     
not in each other,     
but in the canvases of the old art.     

Your,     

Paul

## To Huckleberry Rimbaud in the Hotel New Orleans

When I think of you     
I think of a rock     
falling in a deep channel,     
wavering through the depths,     
your mouth filled with the muck     
of the bottom, that cathedral     
of compost and whiskey bottles     
where the eleven lives     
of madness are worshipped.     

Yet the Mississippi     
keeps rolling on in your eyes,     
over those lies you tell     
that drip with a muddy truth,     
the boy-strong myths of your heroes     
and their victims in the shotgun shacks     
of Memphis and Fayetteville     
where libraries of poetry spill     
from the tongues of swamp rats.     

I listen to you say     
only the daintiest of poets     
would perfume the roses in a garden.     
Real poets grab the thorns,     
grip them tight until blood     
drips down the elbow     
and the taste of death     
flavors every word, those bullets     
of love that pour forth.     

I could say your art     
is a raft journeying     
down a river, little more than saplings     
lashed together into a prayer,     
but each morning when you wake     
you always play the fool     
fanning the flames     
of yesterday’s manuscripts     
to start again as the blank page.

## Viewing Goltzius’ *Young Man Holding a Tulip and a Skull, 1614* at the Morgan Library and Museum

J. Pierpont Morgan, I browse     
through your library today     
to admire all the world’s wonders     
that money could buy:     
from the Guttenberg Bible     
to Mozart’s handwritten manuscripts     
and Babylon’s stone tablets carved     
with lion-headed eagles.     

But I pause before this drawing     
depicting a young nobleman     
regaled in the era’s finest clothing,     
face plump with youth and the good life,     
a skull in his left hand,     
a tulip in the right pressed     
against the bony forehead     
as if one grew from the other.     

And you who once owned     
everything we survey,     
did you ever take time     
between your backroom deals     
and dinner at the club     
to linger before this portrait     
and ponder its meaning? Tulips and skulls,     
it’s what make us all equal in the end.

## Archipenko’s Standing Concave (or the Glorification of Beauty), 1925

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*America is the only country not jaded or rent by war.*     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*– Alexander Archipenko, 1923*     

How her beauty reflects in upon itself     
like light accentuating its own radiance.     

This could be Broadway or Times Square at night,     
pre WWII, pre Korea, pre Vietnam, pre Iraq, pre Afghanistan,     
the doughboys forgotten as the stock market rises,     
model Ts flood the roads and speakeasies lurk     
around every corner selling good times     
spiked with bathtub gin, jazz, and dancing.     

She could be a flapper just stepped out of the bath,     
looking forward to a night out, gazing at herself     
in the mirror as she powders her body to an unnatural white,     
styles her hair in bobs, picks out dress and beads.     

A woman like this doesn’t need a man, but enjoys     
their admiration, like ornaments that decorate     
her life, wealthy nothings to fill a knickknack self.     

And here she is, her silver slenderness     
before our eyes in the museum gallery, unconscious     
of our presence as she towels off, unable to hear     
the buses dieseling by, or the protesters outside     
chanting to stop the killings in yet another war.     

Completely self-absorbed, she wants us to forget     
everything happening in the world, renounce     
our allegiance to today, step back in time     
to when she was a model in the artist’s studio     
trying to pick up a few extra bucks, and his knife     
carved the concave splendor of her thighs,     
shaped her breasts milkless and tight,     
rounded a small belly above the hairless V,     
and war in their minds was a dim memory     
of victory in foreign lands, a liberation.

## Earthquake Park

You stand where the earth collapsed decades ago,     
never to be resurrected, looking at a city     
rising above the heads of joggers come to burn     
away winter fat or relieve workday stress,     
reading signs that describe that awful day     

when houses slid into the ocean, roads buckled,     
stores and office buildings collapsed. Today, Anchorage glimmers     
along the shores of Turnagain Arm, flashing signals     
of electronic hope across the backdrop of the snow-capped Chugach,     
Alaska and Brooks ranges, beckoning to anyone who will listen.     

When times grow lean people descend from the north.     
You see them all around, walking the streets,     
huddled in alleys, in hotel lobbies, the hunger     
etched in broad lines across their granite faces,     
the boredom seeping from their eyes.     

Here beauty isn’t frivolous. It’s something     
to be worshiped while in season, divided among the people     
according to need, elders first, then the youngsters.     

It can provide sustenance for a year, sustenance for a lifetime     
in this world that is white and grey, and always on the lookout     
for the warm breath of a bowhead, the red blush of bearberry,     
or the gentle sun of an arctic poppy gleaming     
against the raven hair of someone you love.     

Soak it in with all your might.

## Yes, I’ve lived

under patchwork skies     
stitched together by F-15 contrails     
as the President helicoptered overhead.     

I’ve lived through gas lines     
snaking around the block, cars coughing     
on their last fumes as hostages of an Ayatollah.     

I’ve lived in the smoke-filled cities,     
basking in the golden glow of the TV,     
as crimes were perpetrated below my window in HD.     

I’ve lived on farms where the cowpies     
steamed in winter like a hot lattés,     
and the aroma of life and death was always in the air.     

I’ve lived as a statistic in computers     
where the trivia of my life     
was used to calculate my next thought, next impulse.     

I’ve lived under the threat of a mushroom cloud ascending,     
ducked-and-covered under a school desk, or tiptoed,     
my nose touching the clouds in fear of sarin gas blanketing the ground.     

I’ve lived with a flower in every window     
catching the morning or evening sun     
as the hungry scavenged through dumpsters in the alleys.     

I’ve lived with both joy     
and sorrow battling for control of my mind,     
and managed to live nonetheless.     

I’ve lived with the constant light of one woman     
warming my life,     
lived magically, lived fully     

on this planet     
in the grace     
of a single star.
