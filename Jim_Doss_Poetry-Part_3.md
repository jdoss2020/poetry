## Today I Will Make a Change

Maybe, I answered to the graffiti on the wall above the urinal.  
Perhaps, if only things were different than they appear.  
Conceivably, if my power ball numbers hit tonight  
or I trip over my fairy godmother staggering home.  

Stranger things have happened, Lord knows. 
Lightning could carve its mark on my forehead.  
The finger of God could strike me blind.  
My testicles could shrivel into BBs.  

Who can say? But if the ocean can tear itself up like confetti  
then reassemble.  If a crab can grow a claw back  
lost in battle.  If a man can take a breath  
after the doctor has smoothed the sheet over the body  
and left to make his call.  

Maybe, just maybe,  
somewhere amid the horse shit and barn owls  
and the roads that swallow stones,  
like a faceless watch glowing through the well of childhood  
my masterpiece awaits.

## Buy the Ticket, Tame the Ride -- Hunter S. Thompson


Bible country. Protesters line  
the road to the Super Wal-Mart  
thrusting posters of bloody fetuses  
at the cars passing by, babies  
with heads caved in by the suction devices,  
torsos torn in half by steel claws.  

These are my people come  
from the wilderness to smite evil. These  
are my people moving through the desert  
of their discontent past the golden calves  
and statues of Ba'al to receive  
the words born by Moses. These are my people  
drinking from the spring in the rocks  
where the staff struck, eating the manna of heaven.  

I see them walking across  
the parking lot, fathers and sons arm in arm,  
dressed in worn jeans, glistening  
as if they'd just stepped  
out of the river with the holy spirit  
dancing on their tongues.  

In the produce aisle, they test  
the bananas, the oranges  
with hands hard as coal, soft as doves,  
always on the lookout for anything  
touched by the serpent.

## Jim Carroll (8/1/1949 - 9/11/2009)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*There ain't much time left, you're born out of this insane abyss  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you're going to fall back into it, so while you're alive  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you might as well show your bare ass.*  

I wanted to be Jim Carroll, sleek  
as a cheetah, skin white as the moon,  
a shock of red hair dripping  
onto my shoulders  
like overcooked cabbage, face  
gaunt as a Celtic death mask.    
I wanted to grow up on the lower east side
shoot hoops on rusted metal rims,  
hear the music of leather against iron,  
sniff glue to the Stones singing  
"Love, sister, is just a kiss away,"  
put the spike in my arm  
to feel that liquid candy high  
blowtorch its way through my brain.  
Place me among the sweaty  
jock straps and gym uniforms    
of Catholic School, place me  
in the bus station restrooms giving blow jobs  
to married businessmen living double lives  
to pay for my next fix,  
place me with a pen between my fingers  
recording the DNA of all the dirty angels  
that cruised my alley-way dreams  
at night. Let me be Andy Warhol's  
gofer at The Factory, make me the om   
in Ginsberg's chant, photograph me 
as Maplethorpe's piss christ,  
dress me up as Patti Smith's rock 'n' roll nigger.  
Then set the guitar in my hand,  
my nihilistic Excalibur  
extracted from the shit of life  
to smite the smug and self-righteous,  
spark the fires of redemption  
in the oily sewers of my season in hell  
as I rise like a phoenix on the pure lip of flame.  
Finally, let me die at my desk on 9/11,  
any 9/11, the hour before the planes  
hit the World Trade Center,   
scrawling my last missive to the world,   
each ass cheek kissing this abyss goodbye   
as I enter the next one.

## Alan Turing

I wanted to be Alan Turing, eccentric,  
reticent, stuttering momma's boy,  
riding my bicycle all over the English countryside.  
I wanted to perfect that blank stare   
of the idiot savant that infuriated   
his school teachers, gave those square,  
chiseled features an air of otherworldliness  
as he raised his head mystified  
they could pose such simple questions  
while his mind was occupied flipping through  
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  
I wanted to attend Cambridge,  
prove the *Entscheidungsproblem* unsolvable,  
argue with Wittgenstein about the absolute truths  
that could be defined by mathematics.  What could be better  
than smelling the damp pageantry of the oaks  
at Bletchley Park as he peddled his bike  
to the cottages in the stable yard  
where he tore apart Hitler's Enigma machine,  
deciphered the secrets of its unbreakable code,  
invented his own bombe to mimic the turn of the rotors  
and break the Nazi code as the Battle for the Atlantic   
changed in favor of the allies?  I wanted to dream   
the electric brain, the machine that could think  
for itself, learn and grow like a child.  But I didn't  
want to get the Oscar Wilde treatment,  
those female hormone shots to cure my deviance,  
feel the breasts growing beneath my Barberry jacket.  
I just wanted to love, undisturbed, in secret,  
like some sparrow that flies from the chimney,  
not a Snow White who takes a bite of the apple  
and never wakes, bluish lips and fingers,  
the smell of bitter almonds in the room,  
gone like those who stepped into the gas chamber  
unaware they could not be saved.

## Keeping the Corpse Alive

Take two lovely crossed legs  
on the other side of a lampshade  
and cozy up to my imaginary absence  
until I taste like the salt of an olive drowning in a martini.  

Roll your eyes over me like the ocean washing a man clean.  
Forget the jangle of keys.  I am a long hallway  
without doors or wasps or ivy or sleep.  Walk through me  
like a field of jasmine where wagon ruts cut a trail over the mountains.  

Read me like a book written in braille,  
a whirlwind of symbols you don't understand like woodchips  flying from an axe.  
Make me into a curtain that always shades the hours you should be asleep.  
Pretend I am not watching you watching me.  

Then imagine we aren't in the bedroom,  
beautifully parallel under God's perpendicular gaze,  
singing our hymn of hallelujah, hallelujah,  
always just as impossible as the first time.  

That we are two strangers gazing on either side of a shop window  
at a reflection of ourselves, that we are liars  
who always tell friends the truth of their tragedy  
without heroes or miracles or fights to the death.  

That life is nothing more than a flower in a lapel,  
the smell of shampoo in hair  
that tricks bees into believing  
the time for gathering pollen can wait.

## Abandoned Orchard

Seven hags on a hill beating a rug with their canes,  
these mysteries of love that keep us going,  
keep us from shipwrecking in the nights of our blindness,  
when drunken strangers wander off with daughters  
who are charmed by their bad accents, dime store cologne,  
garlic on their breath.  One day of silence,  
two days, weeks, the condemned and the protected.  
If they can push out a few blossoms why can't I.

## Ecce Homo: Wie man wird, was man ist

*Friedrich, I do not hate you, or your fear of becoming holy.  Why are you here?  No true god would allow themselves to be crucified when they could goosestep through all of eternity.*  That much we can agree on.  Yes, but why are you here? *To tell you you’re the alpha and omega, the final solution.*  You tremble, what are you afraid of?  *Only my own shadow moving like a scythe across the plains where the armies meet.*  What do you hear?  *Only the wind passing through my lungs with the rhythm of the sea as the prows of warships slice through the waves.*  What do you taste?  My own blood and the blood of millions.  *Do you recognize me?* I am a prophesy unto myself, the übermensch scaling the rarest heights, breathing the rarest air.  *Have you seen me before?*  No, you are a stranger to me, like dishwater thrown out by the maid, table scraps tossed to the pigs.  *Do you know my touch?*  How can the stars know the swirl of blackest space around them when they shine so bright? *I am your vacant-eyed destiny, the peace you seek slowly covering you like ivy until there is nothing left, nothing but the singularity of your mind.*

Loyalty
 
He was the only man I ever loved. Could love, really  What else can you say about the hand that feeds and baths you, scoops your poopies out of the back yard., tosses the ball until you get bored with chasing it.  I hate to get sentimental, but you know how it is.  *Just let it all out, you’ll feel better.*  I don’t know what I’ll do without him.  I didn’t even mind the smell or taste of his feet as I chewed on his old tennis shoes.  It was almost a mystical experience, like dropping shrooms.  *Very interesting, any left in the closet that can be shared?*  No, the bitch threw them all out, cursed his ghost for cheating on her.  But who can blame him for chasing any tail that can be scented within a square mile.  *Very true.  It’s only natural.*  He was good for me, so good, I’ll never be able to train another master.  *Now, now, I’m sure everything will work out alright.*  The whole house smells like disinfectant, not even a whiff of him left in the darkest corners. I’m going crazy, doc.  Uncontrollable scratching, clumps of hair caught between my claws, I must be coming down with the mange.  But in my dreams we’re running through the fields, chasing rabbits, flying kites, two perfect bodies in full stride, two bowls of happiness soaked in gravy just waiting for us to dig in.

## How the Name is Spoken

He has a face like a grasshopper.  
When he yawns his mandibles  
move like the arms of a combine   
chewing row after row in a corn field.  
His siliva stinks as bad as a spittoon   
sloshing month-old tobacco juice.  
I empty him from my mind, take the hook   
and thread first through one rainbow-colored eye   
then the other. The fish shoot like stars across the night sky,  
color my black flag of surrender with skull and crossbones.  
I cast the body where the moon ripples into a mouth  
large enough to swallow the world, small enough to spit gristle.

## How Big is Infinity

First put on God's death mask.  
Peer through the eye-holes as if you were some all knowing being.  
Grab each end of the universe and stretch it like molten glass  
and then stretch it some more until it shatters into a thousand pieces.  
Keep repeating until someone asks you what you're doing,  
why not take a coffee break.  So you sit down with him  
at the counter of a diner, run your finger around the lip of your mug,   
savor the aroma curling toward you like a steamy question mark.    
That stranger, now your friend, seems a lifetime away   
sitting on the stool beside you, patting you on the shoulder.  
He speaks, but the words can never catch up.

## Biograph Theater
 
You are the cigarette dangling from pursed lips, and I,  
I am the match that flares to illuminate your features,    
casts the shadow of your profile into deeper nuance   
until the mystery that is hidden behind layers of mascara 
flakes down like ash to soften this black and white shot,  
and the director zooms the camera lens in tighter to capture  
the smoke that questions our being, the kiss of lipstick,  
the breath now visibly flowing between us, shared  
like bootlegged liquor.  I don’t know if you’re the secret  
of secrets, the one who has no name, the words my soul  
burnt itself up to hear.  You smell like a rose plucked  
from the barrel of a Tommy gun, so dirty only fire  
can make you clean.  I bring you my drop of blood, 
my tear of sulfur and all the hurt one life can muster.  
My body is left spent on the sidewalk, the glow dimming  
in my eyes as you slip through the gathering crowd,  
and your red dress fades into a darker gray before the camera  
pans out and no one here follows you into history.  
pans out and there's no one left to follow you into history.

## The Visitors of Night
 
You are like a wine bottle three people drank from, twist top, and I,  
I am the fire they squatted in front of spinning their yarns,  
casting dice in the moonlight, deadeyed as the steel  
firing pin that sends the bullet in motion, biting as the knife  
that carves our initials into every tree.  Is this love, the singer  
wailed over the dark forest we roamed searching  
for squatter's rights, a warm place out of the wind.  The hollow,  
well-trampled, where they settled for the night grew into a home,  
a place where the branches weaved a roof above our heads.  
Here I came to love these dirty fingerprints they left on your body,  
the smear of their lips on your month, the dregs they left in your soul   
that longed to be replenished.  Here you grew to cherish the ash 
and charcoal that is my eyes, my lungs, my spleen, and the blood  
that flows through my veins like acid.  The skull  
of the small animal they ate, its bones, are scattered in the shape  
of that constellation we swore on called Orion the hunter.  
Their feet may be long gone, but their cruelty joined us together,  
sure as any arrow that splits two hearts in its random flight.

## Dadascope
 
what if the tourniquet around your neck  
were suddenly released  
and the blood rushed back into your pupils  
and you could now tell the exact time of day  
from the shadows cast by women in high heels  
see the birds nesting in their ballerina hair buns  
taste the black wing of flight  
the chauffeur opens the door  
for today’s new nobody  
there should be boats  
there should be a dreamscape  
there should be hands ascending like balloons  
the soul hums in the cavernous quiet of its hive  
your eyelids fall like guillotines  
on each image that leaves and enters

## The Unvanquished

They had that "you can trust me with your life" smile,   
the twinkle of a shooting star in their eye,  
and the swoop of hair cresting the forehead  
that made women want to hang ten in its surf.  
How long had I watched my father and the President  
crack jokes in stereo, one on TV, the other in the living room.  
Now there was no joy seeing the caissons roll  
past the Capital, the riderless horse with boots turned  
backward in the stirrups clop its lonely path toward forever.  
Why must people die?  I asked the blank stare,  
the upturned cuffs, the pencil holder  
in the shirt pocket, the pipe with its smell of gunpowder,  
my words reverberating in the silence   
of the grassy knoll.  Three years later his own heart  
assassinated itself, a single bullet coursing  
through his veins, the ex-Marine felled  
by what he couldn't see coming,  
the triangle of flag presented to me by the honor guard,  
the snap salute of a grateful country,  
that question still burning in my mind like an eternal flame.

## Inventing God

Does He know I exist?  Of course He does,  
He is everywhere, knows everything, no one can hide,  
my father said, his willowy mustache dancing on his lips,  
fingers taping nervously on the hymnal to the slow grind of the organ.  
But when the preacher's Old Testament voice boomed from the pulpit  
I knew I must make myself small as a speck of dust carried unseen on the wind.  
I must hide where not even the badgers can go,  
veined like minerals, untouched by shovels, sleeping the deep sleep of the earth.  
I must have the tenacity of rust hiding beneath the paint of an iron bridge,   
growing below the exterior in the darkness and rain  like a cancer. 
I must be so strange He will look past me in pity and embarrassment  
He could have created such a creature.  I must never comb my hair,  
carry the snag of cockleburs with me like the vermin of a plague,  
or make myself attractive in any way.  I must bear the wayward  
thoughts swimming through the brains of all these women  
filling the pews with their self-pity, a crow-like remorse cawing over their bodies.  

Or should I make myself large as the sky, storm clouds rolling  
across my eyes, lightning flashing from my teeth? Would He  
fail to notice me then, looking right past me like Rilke's panther  
subconsciously block out the bars of its cage? Or should I come to Him  
like rain in the apple, the snap of its core as the sugar is released?  
Should I hide beneath the lichen that clings to the bark as the heartwood  
draws the coolness of the earth into its spin. Should I laugh  
when he laughs, cry when fire sweeps across the mountains,  
open my marrow to his speaking in tongues? I must strip back my covers,  
make a place for Him, open my legs to receive the Word,  
feel the doughy babies scream their first breaths in the dust of His arms.

## I Reclaim
 
I reclaim the forty acres of my closet I let lie fallow,  
the blisters rising on my palms like bloody moons    
as I till the soil harvesting its crop of skeleton keys.  
 
I reclaim my bed that kneels in the corner  
like a monk with folded hands  
sworn to silence for the crimes of my dreams.  
 
I take back all the shiners I gave and received  
on the playgrounds, a stray dog scratching  
behind itself with a Dylan Thomas flair.  

I draw the bow of regret tight against my cheek,  
let the arrows fly like Odysseus confronting the suitors  
in the guise of my older self to take them out one by one.  
 
I gather all those “you’re not good enoughs”  
rolling off the teachers’ lips into a bouquet  
of blood red roses to give to my one true love.  

I dust off those tools I used to jimmy  
my way into people’s hearts,  
to pick the locks of the past.  
 
I reclaim that boy with the crew-cut  
always dressed in someone else’s hand-me-downs  
waiting behind door number 3.  
 
I take him just as he is, crooked teeth, bruised knuckles,  
Technicolor visions blooming in his eyes  
the same way moss always grows on the north side of trees.  

-----------
Technicolor visions blooming in his eyes,  
the babble frothing on his lips like some kind of hillbilly poetry.

## I Reclaim

I reclaim all the hours awake by the window  
writing messages of moonlight  
in the voice of Billie Holiday   
played through an old Victrola needle.    

I reclaim the secret life of the gigolo  
standing half in light, half in darkness  
like a deck of marked cards  
I can recite by memory, identify by touch.  

I reclaim that lightning before death  
that burns the pillows of the sick,  
leaves their silhouettes humming  
the last refrains of favorite songs.  

I reclaim the mud of the grave  
raining down like a fugue   
on the rest of my life   
with its scales and repetitions.  

I reclaim all the scars   
that can't be seen with the naked eye,   
covered under by the snowfall of skin   
hiding those embers that still burn.  

I reclaim those words of love and hate  
whispered over the phone,   
in the woods and on playgrounds  
with their thorns and blossoms.  

I reclaim that innocence that left   
like a sick dog to find a private place  
to expire, its rib bones gleaming white  
through the soil like swords of truth.  

I reclaim that snot-nosed brat  
of the black and white photographs,  
arms crossed in defiance,  
the loathing turning his eyes in searchlights.  

Each night I give him the spankings  
he deserved but never got  
to see the tears stream down his face,  
to wash away the pain of what can't be undone.

##  Saved

It could have been the copper penny  
you tucked into the crease of your loafer 
after it was flattened on the train trestle   
as the locomotive shook 
the blue out of the sky.  

Or the kiss that hovered somewhere  
between imaginary and real  
in the alcoholic haze of the dance floor  
as the boom of the bass  
pierced a strobe of black lights.  

Or the water the preacher's  
strong hands submerged you in  
as he spoke the words of the dove  
over your helpless body, and you rose  
to see it flying through rays of sunshine.  

Instead of the cold nose that nudges  
you out of your funk, the shiny coat of fur  
you pulled from the flames before the building   
collapsed and continues to collapse  
on everything you ever loved.

## Orphan

The hand that took mine   
was not called love, or caring, or tenderness.  
It was calloused and hard    
like the boots they put on my feet,  
the comb they raked through my hair.  

Lye soap could not scrub them off of me  
like a stain that barely faded with time,  
a birthmark that blended in with the burn  
of sun scorched fields where hay  
and corn were bundled for the livestock.  

Parents, what are they but memory  
in a land where only the present counts,  
where the chores always lie in front  
and the home with its rows of beds  
and Gothic spires hunches over my life.  

Childhood of dirt and beans,   
ivy covering the railings, the eyes  
of all who would peer inside  
see there is nothing here,   
nothing but the longing to be held.

## The Way It Is

This poem is not about the last possum,  
its eyes shining like large drops of dew  
in the moonbeam of our headlights,  
the seed of its race concealed in womb or scrotum.  

It's not about the shriek in your voice to slow down,  
the air pregnant with emptiness between syllables,  
the fine hair of your arms bristling in the green illumination  
of the needle pointing to the speed limit.  

It's not about the gravity that draws the waters of your belly  
forward in this tide that teems with a single life  
that will change our lives irreversibly  
with its first gasp of air as it slithers from its salty cave.  

The trees wave goodbye from the side of the road.  
They always wave goodbye like virgins watching  
their true loves march off toward the glory of war.  
But where is the glory?  The poem is nothing  

but breath passing beneath the undercarriage,  
streaming unseen across the windshield like so many unkept dreams.  
I feel the grasp, the nails, the tickle of blood, the impact,  
then it plays out in reverse.  Wheels on pavement  

hum a lullaby to lure us into that sweet mental sleep  
where time is not even the tick of a clock  
or the rhythm of a wave sculpting the shore,  
that pod we launch from and return to, us non-survivors, all.

## Dust to Dust


I am the dandruff of Jean Coucteau  
falling through your dreams   
to cover your loveless misery. 
I am that film of dust  
on the looking glass  
you step through  
to enter the underworld.  
I am all that’s left of your husband,  
powdering the shoulders of his suits  
like regret. I am that Orphic pollen  
that fertilizes your life  
from the back row of a cinema.  
I am the gate, the key,  
the magic potion that lets you look  
in the rear view mirror,  
possess him again for a moment,  
keep him from turning to stone.

## Note to the Goatman of Glen Dale
 
A schoolboy's bad moon carves its way across the sky  
the same way your teeth rake the throat of a beautiful girl,  
feel the snap of the apple as it breaks in two.  
I'm not scared sitting by the crumbling chimney  
that looks like a crippled hag, hearing the frogs chirping  
by the ruins of the asylum. What mad scientist unleashed you  
on the world?  What failed government experiment  
left you so disfigured?  You search for the college of nightfall  
where the coeds bloom every time they dream   
wrapped in the white sheet of the dead.  Your hooves  
leave their hexes on this ground washed down from the mountains.  
I track you like a dog in autumn, smell your sad hesitation  
before the fog of blood, the stone thighs of the Virgin’s statue.      
I want to tell you how the poet always cuts his pen  
on the death of other poets, how the words blow  
through the woodwind of the ass like a gun in the hands of fool.  
But you are eternal as the weed, a boat cutting through the river of stars,  
never seen, but everywhere trouble is just beginning, and I your compass.

## To Huckleberry Rimbaud from the Hotel New Orleans
 
I think of you as a rock falling in a deep channel,  
wavering through the depths, your mouth filled with the muck  
of the bottom, that cathedral of compost and whisky bottles  
where the eleven lives of madness are worshiped.  But the lies  
you tell drip with the truth, boy-strong, eating away at the brain  
like raindrops of cancer.  You’re constantly being reborn  
without myth, your heroes, their victims, beyond each era’s  
tragically black comedy.  Only the daintiest of poets   
would perfume the roses in a garden, while I quake 
at the sound of your Redwings’ ax strokes across the dock.  
Any dog can sniff out where you’ve left your bullets of love,  
but why should I not believe in your tongue, that raft  
journeying down the Mississippi, nothing more than saplings  
lashed to a prayer.  Memphis, cold jewel shimmering in the belly  
of a dancer, play me like a mandolin, as I watch a fool fan  
the bonfire of his manuscripts, become the blank page once again.

## Spell
 
all you remember  
skimmed through like a cheap novel  
 
nothing but pain  
your star  
dot of blood tattooed inside the eye  
 
set your compass  
to its glow  
 
see  
the darkness that blazes  
in your shadow  
 
you know the destination  
so well  
 
a kiss    
searching for its target  
 
blue yodel of the mountains  
in your voice  
like a passage from the bible  
 
a blackened thumb  
blots out  
the eye of the night

## God’s Silence
 
I do not hear it in the drumming of fingers on the desktop   
coming from the other room as my son kills and plunders  
his way through World of Warcraft.  I do not hear it  
when I lock my thumbs and unfurl the shadow of a bird  
against the wall to watch it soar above us.  Even in the water  
rushing over algae covered rocks where the mayfly larvae,  
crayfish and salamanders struggle to maintain their hold,  
it is an absence I don’t lament.  I watch the sky redden  
in the west as the deer creep out of the woods into my yard,  
their mouths like hymns of praise for that sweetest weed  
that seems to grow nowhere else in the neighborhood.  
I don’t hear it when I pick up the pen to jot down   
the day’s thoughts, stare out the window to see the stars  
burning through the bloody swirl of night, or when your arm  
circles my waist and our hands catch like the clasp of a necklace.  
It escapes me when I close my eyes quiet as mirrors  
and drift off to sleep feathering the canoe of dreams  
onto that still lake where the mist rises and the loons yodel.  
It escapes me everyday, like the touch of wings that can’t be felt,  
as I walk through the world looking for that room with its naked bulb  
and holy cussing scrawled across the wall, and rejoice I never find it.

## Diamonds

Bless the lion-hearted gypsies asleep  
on the ground beside their cars  
as the trees above drip dew,   
into their hair, their beards, 
these beads of water that gleam in the moonlight  
like worlds peopled with the longing for escape.  
A dog's howl becomes the long bow-stroke of a fiddle,  
the rustling of leaves a tambourine.  I hear feet  
dancing in the meadow, and imagine a fire  
leaping into the sky.  Each day I wake looking for  
that random smile, a wink, those skilled fingers  
that can enter and exit a pocket unnoticed,  
extract a day's wages.  Who am I to complain  
if this happens to me?  Now I see these constellations   
of droplets gleaming in hair black as night,  
strewn across blankets, intertwined,   
the way the universe is shuffled together  
like a deck of cards, joining them in a kind of marriage.

## Fragile--

what I am not: a mirror, flat,   
brooding, self-absorbed,  
admiring my own image.  

My fiends say  
I'm about as sensitive   
as a troop of children who trample  
through a farmer's wheat field  
chasing finches into the sunset.  

What makes me   
want to be so alone,   
the light inside burning   
like a TV that replays many dramas?  

The lunatic in my left hand  
demands a ceremony   
where only blood will gratify.

## Gratify

In Magritte's painting *Plagiarism*  
it's too easy to say: art imitates life,  
or that art is the fingerprint of the soul.  
Your own world remains flat, pre-Columbian,  
with monsters and precipitous drop-offs  
on either side of sunrise and sunset,  

not a globe trampled by irresponsible children  
who backpack off to other countries  
on their parent's nickle.   

The rooms are filled with the songs  
of finches, their nests cut out  
from the wallpaper, filled with eggs,  

as they glean the carpet for seeds,  
hop through tree limbs, build a life  
for themselves within these boundaries.  

What blooms on the table, blooms inside  
the mind as well as outside these walls,  
each mirroring the other's reality.  

You can smell the musk  
of the damp soil of spring,  
feel the pollen irritating your nostrils,  

and this art is undefinable, though you leave   
your prints all over it, allergic to the beauty,  
savoring it every chance you get, alone.

## Instructions on How to Write a Love Letter

1.  Combine the blood of a carrier pigeon,  
and the song of a nightingale,  
stirring briskly.  

2. This shall be your ink,  
bottled and slipped into your pocket,  
along with a Turkey quill behind the ear.  

3.  Board a ship called Night  
with its crew of refugees  
who have all sailed past the point of heartbreak.  

4.  Cast your eyes upon the moon  
as you leave the harbor.  

5. Stare at it until it becomes  
the object of your affection--  
her skin the color and taste of sweet cream,  
her nipples ripe as cherries,  
the green of her eyes  
a night blooming vine  
that wraps itself around you  
until you're intoxicated by its perfume.   

6.  Hear the duel for your heart and soul 
as cutlasses clash and dark figures   
parrying in the shadows.  

7. Suddenly it occurs to you that everyone on-board  
is really just another you in disguise  
as you start to feel every cut, every rope burn.  

8.  Now set pen to paper, and record   
all your sensations, especially those  
where you think you've died for love.  

9.  Forget that one of your joker selves  
forgot to tell you this was disappearing ink  
so you can mean it and take it back  
all at the same time.  

10. Lick the envelope shut,  
then strap it to the back of a passing   
loggerhead paddling toward  
his ancestral breeding grounds  
where your lover awaits  
under swaying palms   
cradling the moon in her arms.

## Chess


The reflection of the game board  
divided his eyes into 64 equal squares,  
64 views of reality.  *You'll need to think  
5 to 10 moves ahead to be any good,*  
he said, stroking his beard like some feudal lord   
teaching his son the laws of the land.   
I watched his nicotine-stained fingers  
grasp the knight, move it in an odd L-shaped pattern.  
My own hand didn't know whether to move the rook,  
the bishop with its sharp angles, the blood-thirsty queen,  
the timid king, the pawns with their shields and spears.  
But he reached across the board, guided my fingers  
to the right piece.  *Like that,* he said, *classic defensive move  
from the book I loaned you.  Memorize it. Recognize the patterns.  
Become your own computer.*  He always played all out,   
never giving any quarter, even to newbies.  *Only way to improve   
in this world where it is war all the time  
and games are more than just games.*

## Amanda

Already, I can see what you aren't  
broadening like a shadow  
in the fading candelabra of your smile.  
 
Grasp my hand, little one,  
and lead me to the piano again,  
if only in my mind.  

Inside you are cells like warring armies  
that divide and conquer  
while we who hold vigil  
witness this negative miracle.  

I want to feel your fingers on my arm  
playing the Bach scales  
the two of us  
grew to love so much  
the melody never left the imagination.  

Life and death, which is the impostor?  
We each have our own answer.  

Though you'll never have your moment on stage  
in a breathtaking red dress  
bowing before applauding audiences,  
you'll catch the single white rose  
I toss on your grave like a virtuoso.

## Indiscretion

This year's deer hobbles forward, balanced on three legs,   
dragging the fourth limply behind it like a sigh of regret.  
Only a car could have inflicted such wounds, yet  
the child survives and munches what green   
remains in the yard. I watch from a window  
fogged over with breath and the steam of tea.  
Earl Grey and its bittersweet touch of Bergamot  
fills my senses, the taste of you always on my tongue,  
every sip a reminder of what's it like to be alone  
without laughter and the smell of a woman  
in the house. The holiday ornaments are still up  
and reflect the splendor of unopened presents.  
Frost comes hard at night and in waves  
like this so-called wisdom that turns a head white  
and leaves little hope for surprises, save one.

## Inheritance

My father is growing wings.  Somewhere in the stratosphere of his imagination,   
he unfurls them where the bees make their nests for the winter   
and dreams of bullets no longer swarm through his blood.  I hear each feather 
slice through the air like a jackknife as he hatches some new theorem  
about how to levitate above this city of churches or how to appear in the mind   
of the beholder as a porcelain crucifix that weeps tears of olive oil.  O holy father,  
he wants us to say, forgive us sinners for thinking of you  
as something less than real, a spirit that's become little more  
than the breath of your departure.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 Nothing could be further from the truth.  
This image of him laying in the coffin dressed in his best suit,   
hands folded across his stomach, the mortuary makeup tanning his skin,   
that is not reality.  Reality is the red smile of a dog bite sunk   
into a forearm, the sting of wind on cracked, bleeding lips, the upturned collar,   
the V of the throat exposed to the slow thunder of his leaving.     
Snow begins to fall as the hearse pulls away bathing the world  
in a kind of purity, each flake unique as a strand of DNA, the markers distinct,  
melting against the tongue to bestow this final gift of prophecy.

## My Father's Left Hand

turned the yellow-handled screwdriver   
to bind copper wire and receptacle together  
so electricity could flow like blood.  

It gripped the pencil that scrawled these equations  
in a black field book, longitude and latitude,  
where the plumb bob fell to earth,  

and pushed black glasses up on the bridge  
of his nose as he smiled at the lumberyard salesman  
loading southern pine 2x4s in the bed of a pickup.  

I see the outline of that hand now in mine,  
the nails pink and ridged, the fingers long   
as stems rising from thawing ground,   

how it gripped the seams of a baseball 
showing a young boy how to throw a heater  
right down the heart of the plate,  

or pushed a golf ball and tee into manicured grass,  
then locked pinky with the index finger of the other hand  
to complete the swing in one unified motion.  

But what trajectory does a life take after it is gone?  
Does it drop like a bird in mid-flight, or continue   
like a satellite broadcasting its signal through deepest space?  

These lives my own hand guides, will they ask  
the length of my lifeline, am I now at the zenith of my power,  
or just want to be comforted by my touch?  

My dad's left hand wore the gold ring that bound   
him to us, this symbol of trust, now dimming in the half-light   
of memory, where wildflowers climb a wall of chiseled letters.

## And he saw what was written there

but couldn't say it or give it a name.    
He was suffering, in despair, his mind   
shaped like a fire fueled by those words.   
His imagination burnt them to ashes,   
only to see the letters rise anew,  
flavored with wine, scrawled in cursive  
in the red lipstick of a woman's hand.  
Other times he thought he lived in a cooling galaxy  
where everything was blackness, void,  
except those words glowing like stardust,  
forming constellations, planets with atmospheres,  
life beginning to crawl out of sulfuric oceans.  
Today those words oozed with nectar,  
buzzed like a Mozart concerto played   
on the lawn after sunset, the flies swarming   
in and out of the light attracted   
to the smells of blooming carrion flowers.   
Each day they were born anew, like some laboratory   
experiment in a sci-fi movie gone wrong  
that unleashed a deadly epidemic  
without a cure.  But that first night  
in the darkness of his apartment,  
they were like a knife rushing toward him,  
the glint of silver slashing through air  
to cut the vocal chords, sever the windpipe,  
until there was nothing he could say, nothing.

## Bridges to Nowhere

For eight hours in the semi-darkness of the plane,   
the sun trying to stoke its little campfire  
bright enough to burn through the clouds,  
I stare at my face reflecting off of the window  
puffy as a beach ball left beneath a palm tree.  
Then we start the descent to Ted Stevens Airport,  
mowing our way through the greyness   
until suddenly the ocean, scaled with ice,   
appears before us flat as a school of washed-up jellyfish.  
We sink lower and lower as the hammock of air gives way  
and the wheels skid to a stop amid a world of whiteness.  
Outside the terminal, flakes fall like watermelon seeds  
diced through the blades of an electric fan.  
My Iñupiaq driver likes lemonade and The Steelers  
as he strokes his matador's braid and speaks  
with the voice of the tundra. I might as well be a dwarf fir  
shagged with one of his 18 words for snow,  
instead of just another tourist come to pan   
for technology gold with a sack full of supplies.  
Instead I look like a round-eyed seal waiting for the club to strike.  
The jawbones of whales, upright, crossed like harpoons,  
mark the entrance to this hotel built with government dollars  
in the hope others would come, step through the doors  
and hear the wolves howling over their latest kill.

## Everyone Forgets 

Hitler was also an artist.  
It's like when the most harden street thug,  
arms covered with tattoos, raps out   
the sweetest rhymes of love in the midst  
of his enemies.  You know the anger   
still exists somewhere.  Your kids turn up the volume  
on their headphones, and from the front seat you can hear   
the sound of boots marching through a bombed-out Dresden   
or the clash of knuckles against cheeks in the abandoned   
warehouses and streets of Detroit.  How can it be otherwise?  
You drive past drug dealers hanging out on the corners   
scanning for undercover cops while skinheads   
seethe across the street handing out pamphlets.    
Your kids, focused inward, fail to see the intricate   
architecture of the buildings, gargoyles and medieval daemons,   
faces that could be so easily captured in watercolors  
or surfaced with words in books or speeches.    
All they hear is the beat, the lyrics a blur of sound,  
the flash of gold teeth, skin tightening   
around bone where the ugliness incubates.  
The corpses lie in the reverb, the sampling,  
the pauses between words where silent bullets fly    
and that stray dab of paint on canvas.  
That is the door behind which all future atrocities hide.

## The Question

It is pondering the reason  
for my existence,  
that gentle corpse bird  
sitting in the tree singing  
its song all night long. 
It comes to me in the form  
of two zombies just stepped  
through the door of the grave.  
They knock and knock,  
and I hear them the way animals  
hear the earthquake coming  
hours before it arrives, that lower decibel  
beyond the human ear.  I am my own   
horror movie, not even safe in the arc  
of lamplight interrogating my hands,  
the hardpan of my face, the weeds and vines  
sprouting everywhere that speak of neglect.  
Where are the weapons?  What is the opportunity?  
I find the Bible cupped in my palm like a tomahawk,  
stained with the blood of the lamb, the words marching  
up my arms like black ants.  I thought my brain  
was a cloud on a stem dusting the highest peaks,  
releasing its burden above where men can climb.  
But it was nothing but breath, breath fogging a pane   
upon which a stick figure was drawn.  They shatter  
the glass. They break down the door, the smell  
of autopsied flesh, always needful, always longing  
for more company.  Few can recall how it happens,  
one cell at a time exploding, until there's nothing  
but light, a dirty light coming out of the eyes,  
dark rivers flowing back to the source.  
From the bottom of a well everything   
resounds, radiantly aware of its own impossibility.    
They touch me, cold as the earth they come from,   
sink their teeth into my flesh, dip their hands   
into my guts.  I'm ice listening to that damn bird sing  
it mournful song: why, why, why, why.  
I'm a glacier falling into the ocean piece by piece  
and floating away.

## Things I Didn’t Know I Loved

Unlike Nazim Hikmet, I’m not on a train to Moscow   
watching the landscape pass through my reflection   
in the window like a menagerie of memories   
parading before me in all their animal magnetism.  

I’m stuck in a cool office looking over a parking lot   
sprinkled scraps of trash and the occasional car,  
a ghost town compared to two years ago.  

And here I sit alone in my chair at a fake wooden desk   
so old school with my pencil and paper,   
creating on the bosses dime,  
the pink eraser marks like a kiss of love    
for those stillborn thoughts that couldn’t survive   
my own cruel world of make believe.    

How I cherish these remnants of what could have been,   
like children who disappeared before they emerged   
from the womb to take their names.  
  
How I love the quiet and solitude   
of an empty office building during a pandemic,  
the vacant desks strewn with the recollections   
of co-workers, everything abandoned like a ghost town   
in the disarray of the moment as work shifted to home offices.   
 
Now a reflection in a computer screen  
is a spark struck from the flint of memory,   
a conversation to be had over and over again   
as years tumbleweed through the matrix of time.  

The hum of air-conditioning through the ducts,  
a friendly conversation among colleagues, a debate  
of ideas looking for that magic potion    
of capitalistic chemistry to bring in more revenue.  

I am not alone here, though I am alone,  
even with the fields sprawling beyond the panes of glass,  
the occasional deer who creeps by looking toward  
a building, abandoned half constructed, little more than an acre   
in the distance, fox on their twilight prowls, and mice  
who sneak in through the drainage pipes at night  
to nibble any stray tidbits aging in a desk draw,  
leave their own type of poetry sprinkled    
across keyboards and notepads just waiting for our return.

## Still Life with Woodpecker

Alone  
inside four walls  
made of southern pine  
a twelve by twelve by eight box  
this diminutive universe of solitude  
without a road running past  
without any wires strung overhead  
or buried underground  
with windows that look out   
onto fir branches  
and brambles of raspberries  

Alone   
with a bowl of apples  
blushing on the table  
a battery powered radio  
the feral darkness encroaching  
like a villain ready to steal  
whatever beauty remains  
the blue cybernetic eye  
of a paperweight weighing down  
my thoughts of a past  
that may or may not have existed  

Alone   
with a rotary telephone  
plugged into nothing  
but the spirits of friends and family  
their silent voices   
on the other side whispering  
unhearable secrets  
of the burdens they bear  
from this life into next  
the graves they’ve dug  
for themselves and their loved ones  

Alone  
with so much I want to forget  
to relive differently  
as distant stars spiral into a cosmos  
of swirling nebulas on the ceiling  
these encyclopedias of images  
arriving randomly like the tap tap tap  
of a woodpecker’s beak  
against a rotten tree  
the treat always hidden from plain sight  
but unforgettable when found

## Georg Trakl

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    *I am a shadow distant from somber villages  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I drank God’s silence   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    from a fountain in the grove.*  

Never mind the deserters hanged  
like clusters of purple fruit   
outside the barn  
where you medicate dying soldiers.  

Never mind the gun ticking   
on your hip like an alarm clock.  

I come to offer you peace  
as the howitzers rumble  
like heat lightning on the horizon.  

and mustard gas liquefies  
of tomorrow’s ambulance patients.  

Already you hear their screams  
ring out like gunshots   
in your temples 
saying you can’t save them all.

You can’t save them all.

Hell, you can’t even save yourself  
with this exorcism of poems  
you labor over each night.  

Understand, I don’t care what you did  
with your sister in the curtained  
rooms and walled gardens of Salzburg.  

I don’t care what drugs  
you take to fight the shame.  

I just want a drink of Mosel wine  
to wash the road-dust from my mouth.  

I want to touch your drunken face   
one last time as we stand  
under the black oak   
that becomes your coffin.  

Wittgenstein is only three days away  
to buy you out of this god-awful army  
and still you can’t hold yourself together.  

Your hands keep bursting into flame.  

Never mind that gun strapped to your hip.  

Never mind the hanged soldiers  
creaking like bells in the wind.  

Take the dark spider of my heart,  
its white sack of poison.  

Inhale this cocaine of sleep  

so I can taste your blood forever  
in the bitter pieces of apple  
sliced by my knife.

## Doppelgänger

Craziness just oozes out  
of the jail of the mirror,  
its cruel confines.  Trapped  
there for what seems a lifetime  
his eyes burn   
through your body  
like solar flares,  
the envy, the remorse.  
Yet somehow he escapes  
to follow you like a stalker  
everywhere you go, draining  
your life-blood with his eyes,  
haunting your conversations  
with words not said,   
taunting your loved ones   
with what could have been.  
He’s armed not with bullets,  
but that powerful potion of self-doubt  
he sprinkles around rooms  
just before you enter.  
You can sense it all around,  
an intoxicating fragrance  
corroding your soul,  
twisting your tongue  
until you are speaking   
in another language   
that makes no sense to anyone.  
And all the while he is there  
pursuing you   
in every pane of glass  
with a wild-eyed grin  
saying I am that person  
you deserve to be.   
I am your destiny.

## Orphans

We lived in an abandoned house  
like freeloading mice or racoons, a stream's  
cool, mercurial waters flowing on one side,  
on the other a rough hewn civil-war-style fence,   
stained with the gunpowder of domestic conflict.
  
Here no one visited us, and no one left.    
We stole eggs from blue jays and robins,  
beans, rice, and chicken from the general store,    
scooped up roadkill in our wanderings,  
twig fire feasts spread all across the county.  
  
We were little more than abandoned   
hubcaps slowly rusting in life's brambled ditch   
on the most deserted highways to eternity. 
 
But we dreamed without sleeping,   
without waking, our bodies like spirits  
wandering through other people’s dreams,  
our invisible hands entering their flesh,   
packing their lives with existential questions  
the way a church collection plate gets filled   
on Sundays by Saturday night’s biggest sinners.
  
We failed to exist in the same way    
seeds can sleep forever encased   
beneath the tilled garden soil. Yet we were   
nothing more than a black wind wherever   
we went and people passed by, kept passing by,     
expressionless, hitching their coats   
tight around their necks,   
careful not to look up,   
even for a moment, into our eyes   
that glimmered like wishing wells of silence.

## Summer at the Edge of the World

I light the candle and look at my watch.  
Four-thirty AM.  It's always four-thirty AM,  
the battery frozen in time like a sports reel.  
I see the black of the scorpion clinging   
to the stucco wall, the curve of its tail  
questioning my very existence.
