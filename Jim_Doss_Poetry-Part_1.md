## Advice to a High School Senior

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Hans Magnus Enzensberger*

Don’t read odes, my son. To see the future   
read source code, map out object models,  
trace the nested logic of programs  
to their ultimate conclusion. Be vigilant peering through this lense.  
The days of troubadours are long gone so no point in singing,  
and don’t expect lists of the names of naysayers  
to be published in newspapers or nailed to the city gate.   
Things won’t be that brazen this time around.  
Just learn how to stay anonymous in your knowledge,  
wrap yourself in the algorithms of AI, plot the courseways   
of the latest quantum processor, make your face and fingerprints  
indistinguishable to the scans, encrypt the chip implanted in your body  
so you can be anyone you wish, and pass anytime you wish  
through whatever machine they devise. Manifestos are for survivalists  
and suicide bombers. Cloud computers will have everyone  
sorted out, categorized, filtered, and punished for the wrong beliefs  
without them even knowing it. Yours must be betrayals of the nano variety,   
little acts of sabotage from within to protect the defenseless, the unaware  
from governments and giant tech companies, their Orwellian group-think.   
Imagine bugs planted deliberately like grit blown   
into the gears of an engine exposing its minute flaws,   
little chinks in the deductive and abductive reasoning armor   
to let truth and freedom shine through, if only for a moment.  
This will be called resistance. This will be rebellion from the inside.

## Mystery Tramp

I bring out the washed-out poet in people and I don’t know why,  
as I walk around this beach town in my rags,   
a five day growth of beard.   They reach out with words  
almost poetic, almost wise, offer their dollar and quarters  

for me to buy my next meal or a new pair of shoes.  
The blank stare on my face, the tremble in my hand  
gives them comfort they are doing the right thing,  
helping the less-fortunate in this place of extravagant decadence.  

I shuffle through alleyways filled with empty beer and tequila bottles,  
casualties of man’s war against himself, dodge puddles of vomit,  
make my way to the beach just before sunrise, or just after sunset,  
to scrawl that day’s haiku in the sand for the sea to consume.  

Seventeen syllables to describe a life of loss and struggle,   
hardly adequate for most, but just enough for a true master  
and the double entendre of his reflection in the boardwalk lights  
as teenagers rush to buy their bottle rockets and M80s.  

I never ask for anything. Yet these tourists keep shoving coins  
into my hand and pockets, punctuated with words of encouragement  
that could have been lifted from any Hallmark card.  Is it guilt or pity  
that motivates them?  I want for nothing but my art.

## The Children of Never
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1. Day**

Their shadows move across the walls   
like silent whispers, following the sun  
into the basement of daylight.  I see   
their footprints in the dust behind  
the glowing monitors, tracking across  
the sandy emptiness of paper deserts,  
scaling the hills and mountains of computer parts  
strewn about the desk waiting for the earthquake  
to lift them up, give them new life. I hear their breathing  
in the hum of miniature fans, the glowing   
pulses of electricity moving through the circuits,  
calculations flipping pixel after pixel  
from one color to the next.  My hands on the keyboard  
cannot crowd them out with any combination of letters.  
Their black trumps my whites or blues or greys.  
I cannot erase them even with the light of day.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2. Night**

In the moonlight they start to bloom  
inside the picture frames of the departed  
sitting on the file cabinet behind me.  
My back always to them facing the future.  
The pull of the void forever draws me towards them.  
I hear the leathery voice of the young Cohen  
singing The Stranger Song, fingerpicking the nylon strings.  
I sift through the leafy words of Neruda and Lorca,  
or mine the crystals of Rilke and Trakl looking   
for that black pain which seeps through walls,  
an invisible smoke the alarms can’t detect.  
And they watch, silent as death, growing ever larger,  
feeding, dimming the electric light, twining themselves  
around the bookshelf, devouring words  
written ten days ago, a century, a millennium,  
and growing always growing until night disappears inside them.

## The Anywhapp Bird

I am the rarest bird of all,  
the bird with no feathers  
who flies through the clarity of shadows  
and the obscurity of sunlight  
on wings that can’t be seen.   
When I walk among the trees  
or search below the tombstones  
pecking the soil for little swords of seeds  
or umbrellas of grit to fill my beak  
all I can think about is flying  
into the unknown, that dark wound  
in the night questioning everything,
not knowing who might be waiting for me,  
who longs for my song or may be plotting my death.  
How will they know I’m coming  
when I don’t even know, how will they  
subdue me, tie me up, bleed me dry,  
cast my soul into the shrieking wind?  
I fly and fly on invisible wings,  
my song hidden safely inside my breast  
for no one to hear, and in the deafening quiet  
I watch the calm storm   
that is blowing furiously all around.  
I watch and watch until I have no choice.

## The Interrogation

We smile at each other in a frowning kind of way.  
I lean back in the wobbly wicker couch.  
He leans forward from the solid oak Jefferson chair.  
I can imagine him dead, ashen white,  
a fire that no longer even smolders,  
rogue to rub against my cheeks  
to mute the flames inside.  He speaks  
to ask me where I was last night, what color  
dress I was wearing, and all I can see are dead bees  
falling from his mouth onto the floor,  
a colony of servants sacrificed to kept the queen alive.  
My own words when they come  
feel like the steady cut of a Miyabi knife  
shaving razor thin slices of salmon colored flesh  
as I run my fingers over my pearls, slowly, hesitantly,  
offer another cup of tea, my brain exacting a coy  
precision from my lips.  Did you know the victim,  
so-and-so, he says, fingering a spiced almond wafer.  
I can envision the poison powdering his lips  
before he goes into convulsions,  
the butterfly wings of his heart frantically opening and closing.  
But he hesitates, reconsiders, thinks of his expanding waistline.  
Each word that leaves my mouth now emerges   
as a young girl in a perfectly ironed confirmation dress,   
a line of them holding hands walking toward church  
as they begin to rise heavenward.  
He seems momentarily satisfied,  
the silence between us like an iron curtain,  
a kind of détente either of us could break  
with an undiplomatic gesture or phrase.  
Still I feel him trying to stare through me   
like someone looking for ghosts in a haunted house.  
But he can only see the façade, the rafters, the plaster walls   
filled with family portraits going back centuries,  
not this gallery of the dead who whisper his name.  
I do not know how he will survive.

## Eating Whale as Spring Arrives at the Top of the World

This seems so illegal. But it isn’t.  
*Nalukatak*. The tribe is harvesting their yearly limit.  
The captain, fresh off the seal-skin boat,  
hoists the crew’s flag of triumph as a tractor  
drags the bowhead carcass across the sand  
and onto the wooden butchering platform.  
He climbs atop the great beast and cries  
*“Aarigaa!”* to the gathering crowd.  
Slabs of maktak fall to the curved knife,  
the delicacy of the eyeballs and flukes  
divvied out to the most honorable families.  
For days the village celebrates.  
What few stores exist are closed  
while the captain hands out *maktak*  
to all who stop by his house.  
Even *Pepe’s North of the Border*  
and the *Le Jardin Flower Shop*.  
My host grins back at me as he  
sets the plates on his modest table.  
The meat looks like dried dog turds,  
the blubber like slivers of lard.  
“This is our soul,” he says,  
“the soul of the people, how we stay together,  
keep from dying of loneliness and cold.”  
I close my eyes, and lift the first morsel  
to my lips, taste the salt, the plankton,  
the burn of the sea ice, and feel the polar bear  
always watching, always lurking,  
waiting for his opportunity to become a man.

## Like a Hermit

Today I walk across snowfields  
as though reading the book of my life written in braille.  

Each rise, each fall contains an avalanche of meaning,  
each crunch of boot against ice is an event that could shatter me.  

Twelve deer kneeling in the undergrowth  
are my disciples of solitude, the guardians of privacy.  

We live off the same land, gathering wild greens,  
peeling the bark off trees, sharing the mysteries of the dark.  

Each morning I rise with frost in my beard,  
my face slowly turning into a weathered fence post about to collapse.  

Miles of razor wire wrap around my body,  
all the wire for counties and counties. It is my burden to carry,  

my burden to bury inside myself with all the bodies of those I love  
to set their threadbare memories free  

as I heat a pot of dandelion tea in their honor.

## The Last (The War on History)

I’m the last Confederate soldier retreating on the road from Appomattox.  1865 was a long time ago, and the soles of my boots have worn down to my bare feet.  My coat is nibbled at by generation after generation of moths until it is threadbare.  Occasionally I use my Springfield as a crutch as I limp along the tree-lined roadway, building twig-fires at night, careful not to be seen by any scouting parties.  How many times have the leaves changed on me, the snow covered my private’s shoulders like epaulets?  And still I retreat, slashing through underbrush, crossing creeks, hopping fences, sleeping in ramshackled barns.  But the longer I walk the more I feel like I’m turning into a statue, my joints growing stiff, metallic, until at last, I become a resting place for birds, a fixture for the eyes of passersby to gaze upon or ignore, streaked by the oxidizing rain.  Then one day college students come to protest my presence, rock me back and forth on my pedestal, try to rip steel from granite, spray paint my uniform with slogans, splash me with red paint, try to erase the memory of myself and others walking through their history.  If only I could speak, I’d tell them if they look deeply enough in a mirror, they’ll see a strange reflection in their eyes – this man in a grey coat walking down a dusty road, blanket roll strapped over his shoulder, chewing on a piece of Indian grass, defeated as he heads toward home, that dilapidated farm house where they still hold the family reunions.

## Moonlight Sonata

It happens this way every night. Moonlight washes over the old man’s sleeping body until it begins to dissolve like a bar of soap. He can’t afford shades for the windows. He can’t afford much of anything other than food and a few clothes in his small three room house. But he lays perfectly still with threadbare sheets and blankets wrapping his body, the confining rectangle of the bed frame as his limbs begin to soften and sag, and his bones turn rubbery. He goes where the gravity of sleep pulls him, sliding down the bedpost like a large teardrop, puddling on the floor like water, flowing toward the doorway where there’s just enough space to squeeze through the bottom.  

In the humid night air of the field he becomes a vapor coalescing into a transparent cloud, a consciousness without a visible body that moves gingerly across each blade of grass examining its shaped, texture, the rough edges trimmed by the lawn mower. He holds out imaginary hands that are dark and filled with the fingerprints of stars. They touch the course bark of a willow, dip into the coolness of the farm pond, brush the new seedlings just beginning to sprout in the fields. Then they move on to the smooth clapboard of a house in dire need of painting, the wood-grain of an antique chair, a playpen he made once upon a time. Now he can see them through the cracked window pane, just two, mother and child, alone. They do not see him enter the room on the slight breeze blowing through the curtains. He stares at them for what seems like forever before he reaches out to stroke the warmth of a cheek and gaze into those deep green eyes for the last time, always the last time, before he disappears again.

## The Lost Pilot

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Poet James Tate has passed away at the age of 71.* 

I read that headline a couple of days ago browsing around the internet, but you’ve been gone for several years now, an unspecified lengthy illness. That face of the smart aleck tenager with the silly looking soul patch of hair below your bottom lip will never be seen again. How it sagged like a bowl of cold corn-mush over the years as your hair retreated in slow motion like an army searching for a trench to hide in.  I saw you once in Charlottesville many years ago. You and your buddy Simic were giving a reading.  You were the warm-up act, and he the featured lion tamer, cracking his whip for laughs.  The audience loved both of you.  Then, again, I saw you at the post-reading party.  While Simic worked the room like an insurance salesman, you stood off in the corner, alone, sipping your wine like a juvenile delinquent leaning against a red Camaro in a drug store parking waiting for the cool to happen.  But it never did that night.  And I stood on the other side of the room, alone among friends, occasionally watching, wanting to walk over and tell you how much I loved your work, even with my high-school level abilities at literary criticism.  But I didn’t.  I saw you as wounded too, just in a slightly different way, as your words and poems celebrated the public privacy of the absurd.  Now you are dead, and I feel like my own life is the residue of a stranger, someone at times I don’t even recognize.  Was it a mistake that placed us in this world?  Who knows. When I head out into the yard will I occasionally tilt my head toward the sky to see you passing through the cosmos like that tiny, African god in your seed pod of a spaceship that you mentioned in one of your poems-- silent, a canary who can no longer sing to make the bars of his cage disappear?  Or will I just focus on pulling weeds, tidying up the garden, lamenting the misfortune that placed these sorrow-filled worlds within us, embracing this escapism of being unable to fly?

## Elegiac Things

Windchimes on the deck barely  
stirred by the breeze, raindrops  
like little tuning forks striking  
sporadically with no sound,  
 
the dark diesel hum of thunderheads  
gathering on the horizon,  
the last strum of hummingbird wings  
splitting the air by the nectar feeder,   
 
the battles between different suitors  
vying for that final drink of sweetness  
before cool night sets in. You hear  
them all through the open window  
 
as you sit at the kitchen table  
sipping tea.  You hear them all  
like the grind of a giant wheel each day.  
Not even idle talk can make them go away.  
 
There’s the second hand on the clock  
clicking away the seconds, the grumbling belly  
of the fridge, the neighbors outside  
yelling at their kids to come in,  
 
the dog snoring on the couch,  
muffled barks in his sleep  
as he chases imaginary deer.  You feel it  
in your spine like a twinge of pain,  
 
a bulging disk that gets tweaked  
every time you make a sudden move,  
as if each day was a walk  
through a cemetery filled with faded dates  
 
and declarations of love receding into the past.  
The mechanical arm of the garbage truck  
rumbles as it empties last week’s refuse  
into the cave of waste and failure.  
 
This row of pictures reminds of what  
you’ve lost through death and neglect,  
the faces of those who may never return  
staring back at you from the mirror.

## October

Leaves tumble down around us  
curled up like lost souls, those who’ve departed  
to another world leaving a crispness behind in the air.  

Reds, browns and yellows suspended in flight,  
just brush strokes on an artist’s canvas  
as he paints us as two dark figures  

in the lower right strolling the edge  
of sanity beside a man-made pond   
as dried reeds chatter in the wind and geese call out   

overhead pushing their V’s southward.  He fails to see  
me take your hand, focused as he is  
on the flaming trees all around, the deer with one  

antler bending down for a cool drink.  He can’t detail  
the soft warmth of your fingers, your palm’s lifeline   
curved like a crescent moon before the harvest,  

or touch the golden fields of your hair, stare into  
your emerald eyes until he no longer knows  
where he is, no longer feels his hand holding the brush,  

dabbing it into the pigments on his palette. We’re now gone  
from his mind, just another detail captured on a moment’s whim,  
ephemeral, yet memorialized in blacks and browns.  

My heart wants to name you October,  
but my soul wants to keep you forever,  
our lives still this half-painted canvas we must finish together.

## January Pond

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  
Green of water plants in the shallows  
peeking through layers of ice,  
current circulating its life-blood  
of oxygen and plant debris  
past fish floating almost comatose   
in this winter dream-world  
trapped beneath a ceiling of silence.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  
Stones polished by the flow  
of the feeder creek,   
mouth open, the unfrozen part  
where the teeth reveal   
their uneven spacing,   
and the voice still sings   
its muffled song.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  
Willow limbs droop like fishing lines  
into the ice. Below the surface  
their buds bob like lures  
teasing summer.  You walk across  
the pond in snow boots,  
each fractured footprint  
a reminder, a warning.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  
Skaters draw their figure 8’s  
in the moonlight, imaging a double   
or triple lutz, the cheering crowds,  
their hand-me-down skates  
always a size too big or small,  
but their hearts still large enough  
to take in the whole world.

## Life in Black and White

A box of stills on the table, artifacts from the glacier  
of time, the snows of yesteryear slowly melting away.  
They are the tarot cards of your soul laid bare  
for all to see precisely where you came from,  
predict where your life is going, the characters  
whose fate will intertwine with yours like Escher  
tessellations evolving into an infinite future.  
First The High Priestess sitting in her rocking chair,  
her bullet-hole eyes staring wildly into the night,   
her tongue ready to cut out the heart of all  
who would dare question her.  Next The Fool  
in his diapers unrolling toilet paper in the bathroom,  
strutting around in a cowboy hat, six shooters  
strapped to his side, ready to gun down any  
bad guys who get in his way.  Then The Empress  
with her sunlike smile, her hand guiding   
her children through gardens filled with butterflies  
and hummingbirds, keeping them from straying  
into the tenements of bleakness.  The Magician   
leaps forward with his bag of alchemy, forever changing  
himself, moving from life to death and back again,  
employed then unemployed, in and out of bars,  
turning lead into gold, then gold into dirt.  
Lastly The Tower sits on its middle-class hill,  
lightning striking all around, fire reflected  
in its windows, the demons of madness and despair  
leaching up from the ground below, hidden,  
but forever lighting the corner of a blinking eye  
or lurking in the twitch of a crooked smile. Your past  
and your destiny are laid out before you,  
these photos from so long ago  
in black and white that you will guard with your life,  
when living was simpler, yet just as flawed.

## Dear Body,

heal thyself. Let the rituxan, bendamustine  
and velcade flow into your veins  
and do their jobs, peeling the cancer  
away like paint on an old weathered door.  
Watch those tumors disappear into nothing  
like the vision of an alternate reality.  
Become the temple again  
that you were meant to be.  
Renew the covenant with the mind  
to live forever in words and deeds.  
Lift the drug fog so I can concentrate again.  
Stop being this twisted bazaar of needles  
and bloodletting, this life weighed down  
by a history of ancient deeds.   
Stop being a garden weed that must be pulled  
because it chokes out the tap root of language.  
Be that flaming arrow you were destined to be  
when you left the womb on the island of Ithaca.  
Be the rebel yell charging with gun raised  
through the backwoods of Virginia  
as the enemy turns and runs. Be that hallowed ground  
bathed in moonlight where ghosts gather to tell their stories.  
Be that paper hive some fool lights on fire  
every now and again to watch  
words pour out and sting the world awake.

## Mr. Cam

Let’s pretend for moment there is a scrawny science teacher with yellow teeth who smokes a lot and likes to wave his arms around as he talks with a raspy voice about the current events of the day, who believes it is more important to teach his students how to think for themselves than to put them through the rigors of biology experiments, surgical dissections, cells under the microscope, squirming amebas in tap water, who constantly pokes and prods his nodding students for their opinions, challenges their positions until the bell saves them from the well-meaning onslaught.  

Imagine if you will this skinny little man in his black-rimmed glasses and bird nest hair who comes to work day after day to teach these snot-nosed adolescents how to think for themselves through the Socratic method, though he is supposed to be teaching science, goes home one Christmas holiday after quizzing the kids about the meaning of giving and charity and aid to the poor. Imagine he goes home for this extended break with his own family and decorates the tree, drinks spiked eggnog, exchanges presents with his loved ones and as the glow of the holiday begins to fade and the needles start to drop off the tree on to the floor he decides it is time to dispose of it, so after the bulbs and tinsel are removed and it is lifted from the stand he takes it over the fireplace and shoves the top into the crackling fire slowly pushing it into the fireplace as the needles pop and fizzle as they are sucked up the fireplace and out of house onto the roof where the fall leaves lay dry in gutters and begin to smolder, spark into flame, igniting the tar paper on the roof, the plywood, the roofing tiles, running down the walls to the drapes and carpeting.  

What are we, his students, to conclude using the Socratic method as his house burns to the ground and the car in the garage explodes, as he lapses into homelessness, with no food on the table, no bed to lay in and no way to get to work.  What are we to conclude from the science of fire, the chemical reaction between heat and organic matter, the mysteries of the mind? What is left to learn?  What more can he teach us?  This man relying upon the charity of others, with new shoes, a new wardrobe, a new car, a basement apartment to live in, who still lights matches for his pipe, who still burns wood, while his own logic lies in ashes on the front page of the newspaper, and who shows up for work each day to confront his students while playing the role of inquisitor, challenging everyone’s logic with the same joy of battle he had before.

## First Love

Dawn’s breathe crystallizes in the grass on either side of the street.  
My shadow strides forward twenty paces ahead of me  
with a confidence I never had.  No one’s out this time of morning,   
save a stray farm hand or two.  I hear one starting up the red  
Farmall tractor to head out to the tobacco fields where the leaves  
are being to brown with flavor.  He carries with him the smoke  
of last year’s harvest.  I can smell that and the gasoline fumes  
as he waves passing by, saying early for a teenager to be up  
and about.  I shrug and keep walking past the abandoned house  
with its centuries of history crawling up the walls like ivy.  
How many days did we play inside on the creaky floorboards,  
in rooms where babies were birthed and spanked, funeral vigils held,  
flowery weddings that ended in a celibate life of silence, and ghosts   
that chase each other down the corridors at night.  I cut across  
the meadow to get to the next road past the rusted cast iron fence  
encircling the family graveyard with its rain-faded markers  
and final resting places sinking like a feather bed under  
an unknown weight. I walk along the train tracks for several  
hundred yards before heading toward pavement again.  
In the distance I can see the Volunteer Fire Department  
with its rickety 1940’s fire engines and its people always asleep.  
In the field behind the building the unwashed carnies are still  
snoozing in their tents after a long night of cotton candy,   
fortune telling, ring tosses, merry-go-rounds and bumper cars.  
It was here last night when the unexpected happened,  
when the plainest of Becky’s took my hand at the top   
of the Ferris Wheel and the whole world began to spin like vertigo,   
my eyes going round and round, my body hot and sweaty   
against the cool night air.  What was this feeling I want to experience  
again and again, unpleasantly pleasant, awkward, speechless?  
My hand still has the imprint of that night burned into it,  
the lifeline growing stronger with each fragile memory.

## Sermon for the Fallen

I want to live in a place where they’ve never heard of death,   
where everyone walks around in blissful ignorance  
that their life is going to end one day, where pain and loss  
are not thoughts people dwell on as they go about  
their daily lives. I see the barber and the antique dealer  
on Main St. sunning themselves in chairs as they wait  
for customers to show, and little children with backpacks  
skipping home from school into the arms of their families.  
I see the hill where a funeral home would normally be  
remains pasture land with horses grazing on the stubble,  
and city hall has no window that says “Register of Wills.”  
Yet on the horizon there are clouds gathering, flashes  
of lightning, trees whipsawed by the wind, driving rain  
heading towards us, but it always takes a left or right turn,  
always skirts around the edges of our little town like  
a fiery sermon that never gets delivered from God’s pulpit.  
No one asks who’s missing from the normal breakfast  
at the diner.  There’s no sense of absence in our lives,  
that vacancy that can’t be filled by a thousand prayers.  
There’s just the certainty that today will be exactly   
like yesterday.  The same people will walk by, knock  
on our doors, call on the phone, meet us on the playground  
or at the drive-in, and we will love them the way we always   
have, their spirits with us forever in mind and body,  
not just negatives on camera film, or voices and shadows  
in home movies, but in front of us to touch and hug each day.

## Mercy

To be merciful  
said the old woman  
is to live with head raised,  
to peer out across the roads and fields  
for the weak and downtrodden,  
to bring them home and nurse  
them back to health  
until they rise up out of the ashes  
in the process of being reborn.  

To be merciful  
said the yellow tulip  
is to poke my head  
out of the ground when the days  
begin to turn warm, when the snow  
melts into the first shadows of leaves  
and as winter-weary people walk by  
shine brightly like my own little sun  
burning a smile into somebody’s miserable day.  

To be merciful  
said the dog  
is to place my head in the lap  
of my owner when he is sad,  
to lift him out of his sorrow  
and get him to focus on other things,  
to walk the halls of the hospital on a leash  
as therapy for the cancer patients with their IVs,  
to take their minds off death for a moment.

## The Mystery of Faith
 
Envelopes arrive filled with the ashes of Notre-Dame Cathedral.  Each day a new one, postmarked from different arrondissements. I empty the soot and cinders onto my desk here in America, shape the mound into a cross, a kind of holy ground where my soul can kneel in peace. Who is this mystery sender, an ocean and a language away? Am I just a cruel joke to them, or is this an act of mercy? Night brings the sound of flames, the rush of air and heat through my brain’s rafters, a steeple that collapses in on itself. Yet just before sunrise I see the altar’s gold gleaming through the smoke, a wine-filled chalice unharmed, the Virgin framed in rays of gilded light through which my bride steps to lift me up from the catacombs of sleep, place me on the streets of Paris in front of a mailbox holding an envelope, making the sign of the cross before I open the door.

## Bricklayer

I once watched a man lay bricks  
kneeling and standing on a scaffold  
with a trowel shaped like an old metal iron  
before the invention of electricity.  He dipped  it  
over and over into a tub of cement  
placed beside him to pull out globs  
that he’d fling on top of the brick he’d set   
a few minutes earlier before slowly grinding  
the next brick into place, scraping off the excess  
cement to fling it on his next target.   
When he ran low, his partner would pick  
up two stacks of four from the bundle  
on the ground and toss them gracefully  
upward as the bricklayer’s thick hands  
caught the batch whole as skilled  
as any professional football receiver and placed them  
on the wooden planks in a neat pile for the next  
rows as the wall grew in height.  Hour after hour,  
day after day they labored in this symmetrical rhythm  
until the façade butted up against the roof line  
and the final gaps were filled with their absence.

## (In)Seine

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for Paul Celan*

He drowned himself nearly fifty years ago  
over love.  A different kind of love.  
Of self, and language.  The god of words,  
vengeful, spiteful, filled us with illusions.   
Our quarrel began that day and continues  
like a one-sided marathon, him talking backwards  
through time, me talking forwards, tripping, stammering  
over every stone, lost in the black forest  
of his thoughts.  His wound’s mark in the air,  
I always found myself standing in its shadow,  
knee-deep in ferns, smelling the damp, fertile rot  
of the forest floor as I poured the urnful of dust   
collected since he departed into his memory.  
We were like brothers in love with the same girl,  
blonde curly hair, absinthe-tinted eyes, with umlaut-dimples  
on her cheeks.  She was that goal we could never obtain.  
We both failed miserably in our own disagreeable ways  
as we broke the living room furniture   
with our verbal gymnastics.  Moonshadows   
possessed him, together with star-swifts  
darting through the night sky.  I find myself always   
writing in a strange voice, clutching icicles   
plucked from his brow as if they were pens.

## Waiting for an Elevator at the University of Maryland Medical Center

Guess my illness and I’ll guess yours,  
I want to say to the crowd gathering  
around the 9th floor bank of elevators.  
Who here is contagious, please raise your hand  
and take the next car down.  But I don’t   
have the energy or the poor taste.  
All I see around me are the tired, sad eyes  
of the sick, many in wheelchairs, and their caregivers,  
haggard and grey.  My own drug-exhausted eyes  
have lost their focus on everything  
but the bacteria and viruses swirling invisibly  
around us, circulated through air vents,   
expelled by a cough or sneeze,  
multiplying on any surface that is touched.  I want to say  
friends, just hang in there; we’ll get through   
this together.  But a coincidence of timing places   
strangers beside each other, looking for ways of escape.  
Soon we’ll all be losing our hair, turning pale   
as zombies, the bone marrow and antibodies   
in our blood destroyed by chemo drugs,   
only to be rebuilt later with harvested stem cells.  
Two elevators ding almost simultaneously  
and we file into the closest to begin our descent  
into reality as the living dead.  My wife is my rock.  
She guides my wheelchair out of the hospital  
toward the parking garage as we head  
across an intersection, pass junkies  
in the park just starting to get their daily jitters  
and street vendors hawking gaudy wares.  
Next we walk through churchyard shadows where Poe  
sleeps calmly in his grave, unable to even imagine  
these modern-day technological tortures.  
But we still believe in miracles.  We see them   
in front of us every day.  It’s what keeps us coming back.

## Life’s Calendar

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Dan Cuddy*

The days go up in smoke,  
little pieces of my life  
constantly flaking off   
to stoke the fires that keep   
my world warm, vibrant.  

These ashes don’t diminish me.  
They are a mound   
upon which I grow   
into some shrinking phoenix  
forever struggling to take wing.  

I creak and groan,  
an abandoned house  
in wind and rain,  
waiting for ghost-hunters to enter   
searching for their treasures.  

But no one comes,  
so I sift through books   
under lamp light,  
replay the keystrokes of history,  
follow the Escher curve of words  

backwards and forwards  
over the scree and cinders  
of human foibles.  
No one comes so I eat take out   
from below average restaurants  

wondering why everything  
tastes the same, yet so different,  
like a dictionary of word noodles   
arranged in infinite combinations   
to give meaning to meaninglessness.  

Yet sometimes deep in the night   
I can feel my body take this nourishment    
of ashes, compost, and mold it into feathers  
to glide through the air of time,   
if only my mind believes it is possible,  

if only my wings would respond.

## The Taxi Driver

The customer insisted on talking a short-cut  
as he chatted away on his cell phone:  
f- this, f- that, here's what I'm going to do  
to you when I get home..... The language  
was too full of raging hormones  
to be his wife on the other end.  

I couldn't help but watch this old man  
in the mirror with his white hair  
streaming from under a blue ball cap,  
the glasses thick with extreme near-sightedness,   
the wicked snarl on his moist lips. Turn here,  
he said, as a possum's eyes scurried   
past the headlights, then later a buck  
stood in the road before us refusing to move. 
 
Just nudge the b- a touch with the car bumper,  
and he'll run away like the sissy he is,  
the man said as he continue to look  
at pictures on his cell phone.  Later,  
he had me pull over so he could go  
and I watched his diminutive figure submerge  
into the woods. Thirty minutes later I went looking  
only to find him face-down and pants-down   
in a raspberry bush, minute cuts on a wrinkled face   
now without glasses.  Screw it, he said,  
and we headed back down the road.  

I could see him staring at me   
through the rear view mirror as he pulled  
some caramel popcorn out of his jacket,  
made no offer to share.  He was strange like that. 
 
We drove through miles of farmland   
with rock fences lining the road,   
grain towers shellacked with rust,   
hours without a word, the silence heavy  
as a unexpected gunshot in the night.  

Around dawn we hit the outskirts of a town.  
I heard a sigh of relief as we passed a junior high  
and turned the corner into a neighborhood of row homes.  
Eight hours after I'd picked him up at the airport,  
thinking here's an easy fair, this old man  
with nothing but a black binder under his arm,  
said here, stop here, in front of a house painted  
in the brightest Caribbean colors.  As I flipped   
the meter off and turned to quote the price,  
he flung the door open, fled between houses,  
leaving behind a single sheet of paper,  
the message written in cursive: IOU in the next life.

## Gladstone


Grey village of gravestones,  
the dates are immaterial.  

Skull of a church,  
its eyes peering over landscapes  
where dreams die back  
to whatever gave them birth.  

Intersection of railroad tracks,  
sutures above  
where something malignant  
was removed.  

It was here that it happened,  
the great global geographies  
distilled into a hieroglyphics  
of cracked panes and window sills.  

Here where it was born,  
like a two-headed sheep  
left to melt in the fly-swarm  
of thistled fields.  

And where it grew,  
breastfed on stones,  
hardened in the red   
iron-fire glow of the forge.  

There the first victims,   
their names withheld,  
met an anonymous ending,  
endless pages of their lives left incomplete.  

The story never stopped,  
from the one room schoolhouse,  
the clapboard shacks and farms,  
the treachery, the guerrilla warfare of life.  

It continued even after the bones   
began to grow out of the earth,  
seeds in this eternal springtime of death,  
a crop that can never be harvested.  

And then it rose up,   
started coming after you.

## Prayer

Some poet..... I haven't written   
a single thing in three years.  
My mind feels like that dried out cricket  
in the corner of the garage  
wrapped in dog hair  
I swept out into the wind yesterday  
dreaming it might sing again.  
What trivial tasks have occupied me,  
what time-wasters,  
though I live with the frugality  
of a monk, the humility of an abandoned dog  
circling through rain and fog   
trying to find its master.  
More than a thousand sunsets  
have crimsoned   
my mind.  More breezes have stirred  
the elm leaves than I can count,  
more bird songs nudged the day  
awake only to fall silent  
when night's mystery shrouds the earth.  
What is there left to hide from?  
I walk these October roads  
where black-eyed susans bow their heads   
as though the grim reaper just passed by,   
and barbed-wire fences twist their rusty riddles  
for bleeding fingers to decipher.  
I am as close to dust as I've ever been.  
I spread my arms like the mighty oak  
as dark clouds rumble and boil over the horizon.  
Now give me what I want,  
the lightning strike,  
the revelation,  
the speaking in tongues  
from the lion's den.

## Ever Ride the Waves in Oklahoma?

The ground trembles with the thirst for oil.  
You feel it reach up three or four times  
each day and grab you by the ankles,  
try to pull you under.  But you hold tight  
to what is yours -- this biting air,   
these jangling coins of fear in your pocket,   
the trail of tears that brought you here   
where the rigs rotate round and round   
counting down the days with a geared precision,  
whispering of the ways you've fled those you love.  

Yet who can imagine their own end?  Who can plot  
the map of their lives rolling like a log  
through the surf, stretching out for any bramble  
or sandbar to cling onto?  Some might call   
this a destination, others the great crack up,   
the fracturing of a man.  To you there’s nothing   
but an ocean of despair as far  
as the eye can see, lapping up against buildings,  
rushing down sidewalks, spilling from the minds  
of those you pass in the street.  

Cars circle around you, drinking in the fumes   
of history, thirsty for more history, that prehistoric  
sun bubbling up through the ground  
like sweet tea.  Your drill bits pierce the earth  
deeper than you ever explored any human heart  
only to come up dry.  Hole after hole, dark  
and unfeeling as the eyes of your children   
as they gaze upon you heading out the door  
in search of the next strike, that Christmas tree of pipes,  
the wind slowly turning everything you touch into dust.

## Father, Husband

**Boy**

He looks so unreal, lying there,   
a wax figure resting on white pillows.  
When I touch his face, it isn’t flesh I feel,  
but the coolness of stones building into mountains.    
His lips are now silent doorways that will never   
open again, or echo with laughter.    
His eyes are death swans   
gliding over dark lakes  
where crayfish scavenge  
among the hornwort and rotting forest leaves.   
His heart is a tree made of glass  
where each leaf glowed with its own wound,  
a thousand moths circling   
the flames that burned inside of him.  
Time has already begun eating his footprints,  
dissolving everything he’s ever touched.  
Somewhere beneath his eyelids  
is the roadmap my life must follow.  


**Girl**

He will not stay buried,   
the part of him that is a reflection of me,   
that maze of mirrors hanging   
over my bed like a network of gleaming spiderwebs.  
There is no escaping the emptiness   
reflected there, no matter   
how many paper coffins I bridge together   
to reach the other side.  Like a blind person, I dream   
of total darkness, distant voices echoing  
his departure, not even Helen Keller’s pearl  
glowing visibly in my palm, that white seed of truth  
that is the most beautiful thing in her life.  
I dream of quarries where great slabs of granite  
are hauled out of the earth  
and carved into wings of flame. I dream of a hand   
that reaches out of the mirror to pull me into the fading  twilight,  
the nest of bones I must leave behind for another child  
to sleep in and dream of this day.  


**Mother, Wife**

Will it be this way eight,   
ten, fifteen years from now?  
This emptiness like the earth  
has given way beneath my feet,  
like the grave has been dug for me too,  
yet I'm to keep on waking, eating, breathing  
as though nothing happened,  
as though my numbness will blossom  
into a thistle that I can touch each night  
to know I am still alive.  When I shut my eyes  
I still see him in his Marine dress blues  
or on the white sands of Miami Beach  
slipping further and further away from me,  
feel his touch growing faint like the brush of wings.  
I am lost, forgotten, left at the door of the orphanage again  
with two children in tow, two mouths calling out  
for me to be both mother and father,  
when I have nothing to offer but the ashes of my grief.

## Borges

Cards fly from his fingertips,  
one-eyed jacks, all   
staring a hole in the sky.   
Wager, he says,  
his eyes gleaming chalky white,  
opals floating in a bowl of milk,  
his unsteady hand pointing  
at the table like the head of a crane  
hunting in the reeds.  Wager,  
it’s your words against mine,  
this dialect of illusion  
we both claim  
to excel at.  The ivy leaves  
in this little garden shake   
in the breeze like banners  
at a sporting match.  
They could be random pages   
torn from the books  
at the Library of Babel,  
where millions come to contemplate   
the permutations of the 26 letters,  
the near infinite amount of words.  He scoffs  
at my hesitancy, we demiurges  
must know what our worlds are worth,  
both to ourselves and others,  
else why bother.  As I look at  
my cards, I realize they are all the same,  
quads of the lowest order, a tautology  
compared to what he must be holding.  
Let’s get on with it, he says. Time  
may or may not be infinite,  
and neither of us is the eternal traveler.

## Theseus in the Labyrinth

*Keep the shots coming,* he’d yell across the bar,   
whether drinking coconut rum in the Caribbean   
or Jack Black in the dive bars of NYC.    

Line ‘em up five in a row for all my beautiful friends,   
he’d say pointing to the full-chested blondes clinging   
to his pectorals.  Yet somewhere in his head  

there was always the afterbirth of a plan, a scheme  
hatched in the mind of a demigod, sometimes stillborn,  
sometimes alive, an umbilical cord he would trace  

back to the original inspiration, that fountain bubbling with ideas.  
House flipping, day trading, market timing, leveraged slumlord,  
infomercial king always one step ahead of the creditors  

selling the next big thing, riding the crest of the trend.          
Cybersecurity, reverse mortgages, tax liens as the kingdom  
grows and the money rolls in, then rolls out to yachts,  

mansions, wives, divorces, girlfriends, and the hangers-on.    
The entourage followed him like a confettied parade     
from the canyons of Wall St to Belize, from Sydney to Shanghai.  

But he was doomed, one of those pebbles that sweat  
even in the driest of deserts, where there is no rain,   
no rivers flowing to civilization, only dust beading on everything.  

The Minotaur awaited the challenge in human form,  
hidden in plain sight as a police officer, lawyer, judge and jury,  
or just a passerby on the street.  There was no way to know  

when or how he’d strike, only that burning fear he lurked   
just around the next corner, and no beautiful princess existed   
who could lay out the path of string leading back to innocence.

## Grandmother in Heaven


Darkness eases between the leaves  
of the maple as you walk with a basket  
of windfall gathered from Seelman’s orchard.  

In it you've gathered red and gold apples,  
green pears with a touch of blush on their cheeks,  
and blackberries oozing with juice. You follow  

a dirt path raked over by chickens  
to the covered porch with its glider,  
rocking chairs, and moths circling globes of light.  

You hesitate by a long-forgotten door  
where grey wood reveals the soul hidden  
beneath a skin of flaking paint.  

It’s now years before your second son  
will lay in an improvised incubator  
made out of blankets, a basting pan  

and the oven’s low heat as you nurse  
his fight for life with a medicine dropper  
filled with your own breast milk.  

It’s decades before the last heart attack  
will turn your red hair silky white overnight  
as the hydrangeas bloomed in your yard.  

Now you step across the threshold  
to become your father’s plain Irish daughter again,  
greeted by the silence of his pipe smoke.  

It follows you into the kitchen, watches  
you empty the basket onto the oak table,  
count the pieces one by one  

while he sleeps in a lounge chair,  
newspaper folded into wings  
across the soft rise and fall of his chest.  

Tonight you will sit in your room,  
braid a love knot before the mirror,  
waiting for the black haired German boy,  

face sunburned from the fields, but cleanly washed,  
to toss a pebble against your window,  
show you there is nothing plain about the darkness.

## What to Expect When You Become a Banjo

Whatever you were, now you’re just wood, plastic and metal,  
a field hand's distant dream of the Ivory Coast,  
gourds and strings, the lonely wail of never going home again.  

You pass your days in silence loafing against the wall,  
daydreaming like a teenager, letting your hair grow long,  
unkempt, slouching as you slowly drift out of tune.   

Yet deep inside you long for the touch of the hands  
that can raise you out of this stupor, make you sing   
like a chorus of warped angels or the devil himself.  

You feel finger rolls sending shivers up your spine,   
the pinches letting out shrieks of harmony, the Scruggs style   
slides, chokes and hammer-ons raising you to new heights of ecstasy.   

Long gone are the days of blackfaced minstrels tap dancing   
on the steps of Appomattox Courthouse while cartoonishly   
strumming the five-string before cackling audiences.  

Now you sing of coal trains chugging around bends,  
wildwood flowers, mountain passes, lost loves, gospel roads,  
and homesickness from the blue grass to the Blue Ridge.  

Audiences cheer as each songs ends, shout for more,  
but you know you don’t belong here.  Your place is by the shacks    
sprinkled around the tobacco and corn fields, or the isolated mountain   

cabins where lonely men sit outside in rocking chairs   
in the evening heat singing their songs of heartbreak and loss,   
remembering the smell of cornbread and butter beans on the table.  

Finally exhausted by life’s struggles, your voice hoarse   
and strained, you lean against the wall, spend days in silent meditation   
thinking of new ways to say: I love you, I’ll love you ‘till the end.

## What the Ancestors Left


Where the wills were written and signed   
in black ink and the executors carried out the wishes   
of the dead a summer boathouse now stands.   

Its white clapboard shimmers in the noon heat   
no more than a stone’s throw from the hum of power turbines  
that generate enough electricity to light the city we live in,  

and the spillway that greens and darkens with age  
in the trickle of runoff.  I rent a canoe, push out  
into the reservoir’s blue waters to glide   

like a bird across the reflection of sky and clouds.    
I hug the eastern shoreline where my Great Uncles steered  
their locomotives across the railroad tracks that ran beside   

the Blackwater and the channel it cut through the hills.  
Looking down I can see the grey ribbon of gravel,  
the trellis still supporting its steel ready for another cargo run.    

My shadow moves like smoke to the next cove,   
Bill Zimmerman’s old pasture. The fence that couldn’t hold   
his wild stallion when the wind blew in the right direction  

steps from water now to pace a shoreline it can’t escape.   
Further down, the path from the gate to the house  
is hidden by a snarl of dark tree limbs and boards   

bulldozed into a scorched pile of rubbish  
bass and catfish grow fat around not thinking   
of the fingers that left their prints on the doorknobs,  

hung clothes on the line, watched the waters take   
what they’d worked generations to accumulate.  
I can go back eighty years, imagine my grandfather   

shaking hands with old man Z. on the front porch,  
their gentleman’s agreement to buy the bottomland   
that sometimes flooded, but was as dark as his hair  

and produced a good crop four years out of five.  
What is a fair price to some means nothing to others.   
I paddle through history like a man lost in a recurring dream.   

The blister that darkens and grows on my palm is my mark,   
the sign of my own native land, a hillside that rises above these waters  
to keep everything I want to save from dissolving.

## Giving Thanks

Thank you for the soft sonata   
of reeds by the autumn pond  
as we walk its perimeter 
hand in hand so much in love      

Thank you for the children   
we can hear coming through the wind  
of our dreams, their faint whispers growing louder   
like boots approaching on a journey  

Even the ancestors that came before,  
the wife beaters and slave owners,   
the drunks and men of God  
are saying thank you, thank you   
with the seeds they sow    

Even for the sirens that rush   
the dying to the hospitals  
or the applause of the lost   
that greet the false hope of political demigods  
we say thank you   
and cling to the wisdom of looking within  

Thank you for those cutting words   
spoken in elevators,  
the face slaps and nose punches   
and the tender unexpected kisses  
that are the building blocks of who we’ve become  

Thank you for the losses   
I can never get over, mother, father,  
and the losses to come,   
even though the tables will still be filled  
with the most exquisite food,   
and beer and wine will flow    

Thank you for the false sciences 
that brought us the flat earth,    
bloodletting, global warming   
even as we flew rockets to the moon,  
rockets past Mars and Pluto,   
expanding ever outward    

Most of all thank you for this world   
that is always ending and beginning    
that goes on and on into infinity   
even when the sun expands   
into a red giant that swallows the earth    
and the cycle begins again somewhere else  

we will be there, we will always be there

## Reassembling the Beast

look at that tractor all gassed up  
reaping the curve of your eye  
as oceans of wheat dip and roll in the breeze before us  

listen to that watch you carry in your hip pocket  
its wheels powered by the rhythm of your heart  
its hands climbing and descending the rock face of time   

hear them winds blowing the children into the chinkapin  
their feathers splayed against death  
as moonlight floods  
our lost roads into rivers rippling with fish  

feel the crunch of those rocks beneath your feet  
knocking the dust out of your ears  
clearing your muddled head  
that puts miles between you and everything else  

better nail some roadkill to the fence post  
for those evil spirits to feast on  
in our blackest of nights  

don’t go round calling my name  
with your head sunk low like a sick dog  
and expect me to come running  

you know I don’t cotton to no graveyard shovels  
or sugar daddies who own half the county  
with their women and their bourbon  

now dig those nightcrawlers out of the earth  
to thread the hook for the big cats  
lulling in the darkest sinkholes  

fix that stuttering clutch on our one-eyed Ford  
replace the cracked windshield   
with its road map of spiderwebs  

are there spare parts enough left to keep us running  

your way of living is not worth wishing on anyone  
that’s why I’m here

## Blue II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue of intense cobalt, and others of a lighter blue, like the bluish white of the Milky Way   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... the sea was very dark ultramarine, the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the dunes, a few bushes of prussian blue.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Vincent Van Gogh, Letter to Theo, 1888  

How to paint a sky when skies don’t yet exist.  
How to create an ocean where there’s nothing  
but depth and shadow and darkness.  A god must look  
where all gods fear to look,  
inside those chambers of the heart   
where pools of blood come to be replenished  
before the lungs, those patient farmers,  
do their work. He must feel the pain of an artist  
being born into his art, creditors at the door,  
wool hand-me-downs chafing his skin,  
ready to auction off his masterpieces  
to buy the next blank canvas. He must feel vanity die  
inside himself, fruit shriveled   
and molding on a withered vine.  
He must feel his pride shrink  
into the diamond-tipped blade of hunger  
scraping away at his gut.  His ego must leave him  
as though he were exhaling his final breath,  
as if his greatest love just passed   
from his life.  Only then will he be ready.  
Only then can he pick up the brush,  
grip the pallet, channel the anguish of his art  
onto the world: woad, indigo, cobalt, azurite,  
lapis lazuli, indanthrene, no match for sky-blue,  
ocean-blue, mountain-blue, arctic-blue,  
or the blue of a lover’s eyes gazing skyward.

## Late Autumn Journey

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Rilke’s Herbsttag*

Lord, it is time.  The summer was immense,   
but now our shadows fall long across the sundials.  
Farmers who used to lounge beneath   
the shade trees in noon’s heat hustle   

through the meadows to cut and stack   
their wheat into neat bundles,   
load in the back of pickup trucks  
before the burn of the first frosts.    

The grapes that drew their last drops of sweetness   
from withered vines ferment in vats   
that rise to the ceiling of old musty cellars   
where field mice build their winter nests.   

Whoever is homeless now heads south  
seeking friendlier climates, while the lonely   
retreat to their rooms to pace back and forth  
through the leaf-strewn alleyways of the mind, searching,  
always searching for what was lost along the way.

## Primitive Medicine

The middle finger on his right hand was lopped off  
at the first joint, not through some accident  
at the shoe factory, but from a blood clot   
that turned the finger into a swollen purple sapling  
that the country doctor removed with a cleaver.    

He would rub it as he talked, a kind of nervous habit,  
like the bitter-sweet reminder of the son that was now missing  
from his life.  His education stopped in the third grade  
where mine continued, but he would spend hours  
talking me through his hardpan life as we shoveled   
black dusty chunks of coal into the glowing belly of the furnace,  
or walked his buzzing hillside garden hoeing weeds   
around his precious strawberries and tomatoes.  Sometimes    

we’d just soak in the gold of the sun, pop the hood on his Chevy Belair,   
go through the engine parts while he’d make some minor repair  
or adjustment as the smoke of his filterless Pall-Mall   
clouded my brain with dreams of nicotine.  By day  
he was a teetotalling, church-going man with a love   
of country and wife.  Some nights he was rumored     
to hit the white lightning with his buddies, get overly friendly   

with other women.  I never saw this side of him,  
just the old field hand who had no time for tomfoolery  
like throwing a baseball or football, who was a plow horse  
who never stopped working, never stopped turning the soil,  
driving a nail into planks of wood, or gripping a paint brush  
to slap a coat of new on what was earned with his sweat alone.  

Yet he always had time to help a neighbor, or sit and visit  
with a lonely soul.  It was here in this little house   
on an oversized lot in the not so good part of town    
that I learned what it meant to be a grandfather   
to the only son of an only son who could never return.

## Ode to Salt

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Neruda*

Ancient voice of the sea,  
I can still hear you humming  
in the shakers on the kitchen tables,  
by the stove as the meats and vegetables simmer,  
or hear your muffled song in the cans   
of corn and beans on the shelves  
waiting for their seals to be broken.  
From the Salzburg and Hallstatt mines   
to the red rock of Khewra,  
great machines lift you  
from the dark chambers of the earth  
where once you were a primordial ocean  
giving birth to these beings that still crave you.  
In the cool caves beneath Hohensalzburg,  
with its medieval gold and white cathedral lights,  
I first heard you sing your song of praise,  
tasted the waves in your voice, took the dust  
of your body onto my tongue like a kiss.  
Years later I tasted you on the skin of a woman,  
heard the sailor's call of prows slicing through swells  
on the high seas where the rations lay firmly packed  
in salt barrels below deck, ready for the journeys of discovery  
to unknown lands. I tasted you in the blood of a busted lip,  
leaking brine from my body, building that craving  
for the solitude of white ocean spray, its foam  
spilling across the beach, amniotic,  
rekindling that lost memory of birth.  
In the shakers the salt crystals wait   
to cast their primitive light on our food,   
impart every season, every eon   
and era of the earth on our taste buds,   
replenish our desire to once again become one with infinity.

## 1965

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Garcia Lorca*

These eyes of mine in nineteen-sixty-five  
saw no one dead and buried,  
no town turned to rust and ash from one who weeps until dawn,  
no trembling hand reaching for the doorways of the heart.  

These eyes of mine in nineteen-sixty-five  
saw the little boys whizzing in the creek,  
the crayfish claws, the diamonds sparkling on the back of the copperhead  
as it swam in the incomprehensible light of the moon illuminating  
the black walls of the forest with its secret passageways.  

Those eyes of mine on a tie clip,  
on the pierced side of a wooden Christ expiring over the alter,  
on the balconies of love, those stolen moments out of sight,  
in the gardens where the praying mantis recite their supplications.  

Attic where memory’s ancient dust assembles its statues of moss,  
where the boxes devour the silence of history like translucent moths,  
where the sainted dream collides with its otherworldly reality.  
My little eyes are there, peering, drinking in the darkness.  

Don’t ask me any questions.  Don’t try to trick me.    
I’ve seen how things find their own path into the void.  
The air between us is filled with spaces that ache to be joined,   
like hands, like lips, but the darkness in my eyes grows,   
completely undressed, devoid of meaning   
gazing into the mirror that is this world.

## Twins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Christie (1994 - 2014)*


I failed to turn and walk away,  
though my feet moved through the crowds 
past the flowers and other gravestones  
to where the car waited to take me home.  

I remained, even after I’d gone,  
staring at the granite and polished metal,  
the gleam of black ice, the tire tracks  
you left in someone’s front yard, the unbuckled seatbelt.  

I longed to hear the sound of your voice    
call my name again, your laughter light  
as a wind chime when you tell me about the latest boy  
to seek salvation in the oracle of your love.  

I wanted to say that one last goodbye   
like when you were first to leave   
the ocean of the womb, cast out into the artificial light  
of the delivery room, the existential reality of sun.  

I had hoped the image of a church overflowing   
with loved ones and your college friends would fade   
back into two girls bouncing side by side in a playpen,  
wearing matching outfits, so we could start again.  

But this landscape of bone is all I know now,  
mausoleums of marble, winged statues without faces,  
dusty holograms stirred by the wind where sometimes  
I see your shadow following each step I take.

## Mosaics of the Heart


God may look down   
upon you now,   
silent, weeping moonlike    
in this house   
filled with feral cats,  
executing your acts   
of imagination before a mirror   
where you undress  
your guests one by one,   
let their spirits escape  
into the fields   
while their bodies molt  
like dragonflies   
in the heat of your embrace.  

But no one else can see you   
burning in the night,   
watch this sad ritual   
of your deconstruction   
lay down its obsidian embers   
like tiles on a Roman floor   
where others will come  
years later, their brooms and trowels   
sweeping away the layers   
of dust and debris,   
to lament over   
your decline and fall,   
decipher this calculus of pain  
into theorems that defy proof.

## The Next One

The boy’s model plane wings    
cast a shadow that looked like Jesus,    
head bowed and bleeding, hanging    
on the wooden cross above the pulpit on Sundays.    
He ran them slowly along the chalky walls    
of the the airport terminal as they waited    
while his family waited for her flight to land.    
His father paced like a nervous hen.    
His mother stared stoic as a Roman statue.    
He watched them both as the shadow    
of the cross swept across their features    
and they grew irritated with his frivolities,    
pushed him away with eyes    
cold as steel nails. Her plane     
was always late, which only intensified     
the dread of these visits, a pulse     
increasing steadily like the sound     
of marching soldiers growing closer.      
But she was just one person, a force    
of good out to save everyone     
she spoke to, without exception.  He saw     
her plane’s wings tip back and forth     
as the wheels touched down in a puff of smoke,    
skidded to a halt.  When the door opened,    
she was first to deboard, majestic    
in her 1940’s style tailored suit,     
not a speck of makeup out of place,    
her Bible clutched against her breast,    
her eyes probing their souls for darkness,    
any spark of sulfur since the last visit,    
those little hell-fires only a matriarch can see.

## Dear Child of the Future

Today you are just a black and white image    
on a sonogram, everything placed just where it should be.    

Tomorrow you will emerge, trembling with screams,    
into the harsh light of this world, to the breast of your mother.    

What can I give you now to make your journey less harsh?    
Nothing, I’m afraid.  Nothing but words to guide     
and sooth your entry into life.  Not exactly sage wisdom.    

This morning we saw the hawks circling overhead,    
calling out to each other on the hunt    
for their next meal of rabbit or squirrel.    

We are all hawks in our own way, circling    
that which nourishes us the most    
in our pursuit of love, knowledge, and understanding.    

Always err on the side of freedom and responsibility.    
Resist the urge to follow the fear-mongering of politicians    
and the media who want to herd you to safety    
to protect you from their imaginary daemons.    

Hold your true friends close, your family closer.    
They will be a refuge in times of trouble and crisis,    
your oasis in a desert of ill-intent.    

Be self-sufficient in every way possible,    
not dependent or beholding to any entity or person.    
Shackle your heart to the wind shaking the maples.     

But leave this world a better place    
than you found it, shrink humanity’s footprint,    
let forest and animal approach your doorstep.    

And most importantly, when the lilies bloom     
in your parents’ front garden, holding out their beggar’s cups    
asking for spare change, think of us,     
your grandparents, who swaddled you with love,    
and planted these flowers to celebrate your arrival.

## Saturday Night at the Odd Fellows Home

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for my mother*

The biscuits were buttered hours ago,    
the chickens plucked, beheaded, and carved    
into well-defined pieces just as we    
were taught, not a morsel wasted,    
not even the necks and gizzards.        
Dinner for over one hundred kids    
of the Great Depression, who served    
as farm hands, cooks and maids    
to earn a roof over their heads,    
a bed, two changes of clothes,    
three meals a day, and little schooling.      
But love wasn't part of the bargain    
if they were lucky.  Love was something     
they’d left behind in the cabins of their childhood    
with the ghosts of mother and father.    
Love was not today’s hand raised     
in anger or passion by their caretakers    
who always put on their Sunday best    
smiles when the occasional visitor arrived    
and showed the farm’s wonders.    
Love was something lonely and serene,    
like dishes piled three feet high    
on a table by the sinks, like tubs     
of soapy water to scrub off food    
smeared on the plates     
and any streaks of dirty or bruises    
from an unwanted encounter.    
It was the peace of being alone    
for hours doing chores from sunrise    
to sundown.  It was that zone where nothing    
mattered anymore and they were invisible    
to everyone around them     
as they moved through their day.    
It was that walk up the stairs at the end     
of the day to the dormitory of twenty beds     
in one room, footsteps creaking     
on the white pine floors, the cold metal    
door handle opening to a never empty room,    
ignoring the crude comments heading to the bed    
by the window where the moon shown    
in full radiance.  It was finally laying down    
on the hard, thin hard mattress to gaze at that face    
over the barn, over the trees, those lips    
that kept whispering: Come follow me, child,    
don’t dwell in this cruel place any longer,     
just pack your belongings and meet me after midnight     
down by the forge where the sparks fly,     
you know wherever we’re going has to be better than here.

## Egg

It’s a white dome of sky    
you can almost touch    
where the sun barely    
peeks above the horizon    
and your world is bathed    
in an eerie twilight.  There seems    
to be no way in or out.    
You keep wandering along the shores    
of a tranquil sea     
waiting for battles to rage,    
armies to clash     
with swords, armor and spears,    
but nothing ever happens.    
Only the soft sounds of seagulls    
pacing the beaches,    
and you try to turn their tracks    
into words to give you direction,    
companionship, but all around    
is silence, contemplation,    
inner focus.  Until that fateful day    
when clouds begin rolling in,    
the sky grows black as coal,    
lightning slices the heavens    
with a jagged knife, and the earth    
starts to rumble, then shake    
as the ground begins to split.    
You feel yourself falling    
into a deep well, gravity and pressure    
pushing you downward.    
Fear seizes you as plummet    
through darkness to your certain end,    
until a blazing light hits your face,    
nothing like you’ve ever seen before,    
and you let out a scream    
as something grips you    
while you float mysteriously     
through the air into arms     
that welcome you, cherish you,     
give you the name    
you will call yourself    
until that day you return    
to the source of all creation.

## The Mad Hatter’s Postscript to ‘Alice in Wonderland’

Tea time in the forest of delights.    
It’s always tea time.    
That’s the way life goes,    
round and round like a clock,    
backwards and forwards,    
spinning in circles like a penny.      
Alice was such a young thing     
with an ancient heart    
that she needed to be shaken    
like the best cups     
of Darjeeling tea    
to bring out those subtle nuances    
of flavor.  It was up to me        
and no one else to see     
this happened as surely as a little girl    
eats everything she sees     
and sees everything she eats.    
The Dormouse drowning     
in his chocolate stupor,    
the March Hare marooned     
in the winter of his soul,    
what’s a Mad Hatter to do    
away from the fabrics of his business,    
the chemical talcum of the brocade,    
the machines whirring like doves?    
It was sanity that possessed me    
to reach out and shepherd this poor girl    
through the quagmire of reality    
into the world of dreams and make believe.      
For what are we without dreams     
but empty vessels of flesh    
searching for words that start with M-,     
anything that starts with M-.     
And, yes, she will return.        
She will always return.     
Every time she closes her eyes    
it begins anew.

## Orphans

We lived in an abandoned house    
like mice or racoons, a stream    
flowing on one side with cool mercurial waters,    
on the other a rough hewn civil-war-era style fence,     
still stained with the gunpowder of conflict.    

No one visited us, no one left.  We stole    
eggs from blue jays and robins, beans,    
rice, and chicken from the general store,    
scooped up roadkill in our wanderings,    
twig fire feasts all across the county.    

We were nothing less than abandoned     
hubcaps slowly rusting in life’s brambled ditch     
on the most deserted highways to eternity.    

But we dreamed without sleeping,     
without waking, our bodies like spirits    
wandering through other people’s dreams,    
our invisible hands entering their flesh,    
packing their lives with existential questions    
the way a church collection plate gets filled up     
on Sundays by Saturday night’s biggest sinners.    

We failed to exist in the same way     
seeds sleep forever encased     
beneath the tilled garden soil. Yet we were     
little more than a black wind wherever     
we went and people passed by, kept passing by,    
expressionless, hitching their coats tight    
around their necks without looking up,     
our eyes little more than wishing wells of silence.

## Calling Elvis

When you’re done you can walk    
through the door    
with blood on your sleeve    

in the shape of a smiling fist,    
a fist that just knocked the crap    
out of someone.    

You can still feel the needle jabs    
that infused the indelible ink     
beneath your skin     

like a song performed so poorly    
before a bunch of rowdy drunks in a bar    
that even they took notice.  Now there’s no one     

to witness your long walk into the oblivion     
of the night, a cork drifting out to sea     
on the tide of some nameless sorrow    

that you and a hundred Ph.D.’s can’t comprehend.    
Your lips feel the slight hum of a melody     
begin to grow, both the joy and pain of roses    

twining together around a trellis of emotion.      
You can’t think of words to fill the night’s silence     
but with each step your sleeve grows moister,     

the bandage already tossed in the garbage    
before you left the artist’s shop.  Now hay    
unexpectedly flies from the back of a passing pickup    

like a whisper of something strange and exotic.    
Brake lights paint the night with the squeal     
of worn tires.  You continue to walk leisurely    

toward your destiny of nothing     
as a voice calls out, soft and sweet     
as a cemetery rose. Your name and no other.    

As you enter the truck cab you can see    
her pink panties inching out around the sides    
of her high cut blue jean shorts,    

feel her hand brushing against yours    
like a flower in search of its bee.  Your arm    
aches like your heart with loneliness, mistrust.    

Yet that face bleeding through your skin and shirt    
clears its throat, begins to whisper and hum    
“Are you lonely tonight.”  You feel yourself    

singing along, only slightly out of tune    
as you pass fields of horses, cattle,    
and that smile back tells you to keep going.

## Doppelgänger

Craziness just oozes out    
of the jail of the mirror,    
its cruel confines.  Trapped    
there for what seems a lifetime    
his eyes burn     
through your body    
like solar flares,    
the envy, the remorse.    
Yet somehow he escapes    
to follow you like a stalker    
everywhere you go, draining    
your life-blood with his eyes,    
haunting your conversations    
with words not said,     
taunting your loved ones     
with what could have been.    
He’s armed not with bullets,    
but that powerful potion of self-doubt    
he sprinkles around rooms    
just before you enter.    
You can sense it all around,    
an intoxicating fragrance    
corroding your soul,        
twisting your tongue    
until you are speaking     
in another language     
that makes no sense to anyone.    
And all the while he is there    
pursuing you     
in every pane of glass    
with a wild-eyed grin    
saying I am that person    
you deserve to be.     
I am your destiny.

## Still Life with Woodpecker

Alone    
inside four walls    
made of southern pine    
a twelve by twelve by eight box    
this diminutive universe of solitude    
without a road running past    
without any wires strung overhead    
or buried underground    
with windows that look out    
onto fir branches    
and brambles of raspberries    

Alone     
with a bowl of apples    
blushing on the table    
a battery powered radio    
the feral darkness encroaching    
like a villain ready to steal    
whatever beauty remains    
the blue cybernetic eye    
of a paperweight weighing down    
my thoughts of a past    
that may or may not have existed    

Alone     
with a rotary telephone    
plugged into nothing    
but the spirits of friends and family    
their silent voices     
on the other side whispering    
unhearable secrets    
of the burdens they bear    
from this life into next    
the graves they’ve dug    
for themselves and their loved ones    

Alone    
with so much I want to forget    
to relive differently    
as distant stars spiral into a cosmos    
of swirling nebulas on the ceiling    
these encyclopedias of images    
arriving randomly like the tap tap tap    
of a woodpecker’s beak    
against a rotten tree    
the treat always hidden from plain sight    
but unforgettable when found

## A Day of Cardinals

Bird feathers    
on the sidewalk    
as I step out the door,    
red, bloodless.      

No night screams     
from foxes on the hunt    
cornering their prey.    

Just four am window chatter,    
cardinals beginning the day    
in weeping cherry leaves.    

I hear their wingbeats    
like the soft rhythms    
of my lover’s heart    
as she sleeps     
while I can’t.    

I hear songs     
of laughter     
as their hard     
orange beaks    

chase night    
from leaves    
and red berries.    

But where     
do they go to sleep     
and are they as restless     
and irreconciled as me?    

In the frolicking dawn air    
one feathery mystery    
gives way to another.

The last oil rig ground to a halt,    
it’s big piston no longer    
turning round and round    
like a Ferris Wheel    
to pump liquid gold    
out of the ground.    

Gasoline powered cars    
sat abandoned in ditches,    
rusting beneath flaking    
paint jobs, leaking battery acid,    
their upholstery riddled    
with rats and roaches,    
home to any hobo    
who could defend     
this sacred lair from invasion.    

We walked everywhere    
we traveled, past streetcars    
starved for electricity,    
the occasional spurts of movement    
from their useless, ghostly hulks.    
The rich flipped us the bird    
and shouted crude names    
as their eclectic vehicles     
speed past.  But like weeds    
our numbers grew and grew.    

The summers were no hotter,    
winters no colder than before.    
We settled into basements    
as the pipes froze, the walls     
mildewed and crumbled,    
the heat pump fans    
fans corroded and Freon leaked    
from the coils.  We grew     
what food we could,    
hunted and bartered    
for anything we could eat    
as our ribs and hips    
protruded like those of prisoners    
in a concentration camp.    

But the politicians celebrated,    
and celebrated, in the Capitol,    
In the White House, in elite    
restaurants with the best    
food and drink. The pictures    
of their victory covered newspapers,    
billboards and inundated the airwaves    
for anyone who could    
receive a TV signal.  Yet in the back alleys    
we heard the hum of the generators,    
felt the electricity flowing     
through the wires    
to where they danced,     
partying throughout the night.    
And in the motor’s sound    
we knew their fate was sealed.

## Memory, Stay Awake

Keep me from falling under the spell of forgetfulness.      
Don’t let me squander what little grey matter I have left.     
History can so easily disappear into otherworldly     
nebulas of darkness.  Just ask big tech, the news media     

and politicians who try to lead us down the path of groupthink.      
Let my brain function freely to remember all the atrocities     
committed in the name of justice, the assassins and their victims,     
the reeducation camps, the masters of treachery.      

Ensure I never forget those who died in the gulags,     
the gas chambers, and pointless war after pointless war.     
Cement them into my heart where they cannot escape    
into a bonfire of bodies rising up into the uncaring night air.        

Make them impervious to the deniers    
who would erase their fate with golden phrases    
of deceit and omission.  Let me recall both    
the good and evil, as I read letters from their loved ones    

never delivered to the mass graves.  Skull after skull     
surfaces in my mind, the names recorded     
on the scroll of time, each saying remember me,    
remember me for I could be your destiny.
