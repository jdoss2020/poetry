## Advice to a High School Senior

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Hans Magnus Enzensberger*

Don’t read odes, my son. To see the future   
read source code, map out object models,  
trace the nested logic of programs  
to their ultimate conclusion. Be vigilant peering through this lense.  
The days of troubadours are long gone so no point in singing,  
and don’t expect lists of the names of naysayers  
to be published in newspapers or nailed to the city gate.   
Things won’t be that brazen this time around.  
Just learn how to stay anonymous in your knowledge,  
wrap yourself in the algorithms of AI, plot the courseways   
of the latest quantum processor, make your face and fingerprints  
indistinguishable to the scans, encrypt the chip implanted in your body  
so you can be anyone you wish, and pass anytime you wish  
through whatever machine they devise. Manifestos are for survivalists  
and suicide bombers. Cloud computers will have everyone  
sorted out, categorized, filtered, and punished for the wrong beliefs  
without them even knowing it. Yours must be betrayals of the nano variety,   
little acts of sabotage from within to protect the defenseless, the unaware  
from governments and giant tech companies, their Orwellian group-think.   
Imagine bugs planted deliberately like grit blown   
into the gears of an engine exposing its minute flaws,   
little chinks in the deductive and abductive reasoning armor   
to let truth and freedom shine through, if only for a moment.  
This will be called resistance. This will be rebellion from the inside.

## Mystery Tramp

I bring out the washed-out poet in people and I don’t know why,  
as I walk around this beach town in my rags,   
a five day growth of beard.   They reach out with words  
almost poetic, almost wise, offer their dollar and quarters  

for me to buy my next meal or a new pair of shoes.  
The blank stare on my face, the tremble in my hand  
gives them comfort they are doing the right thing,  
helping the less-fortunate in this place of extravagant decadence.  

I shuffle through alleyways filled with empty beer and tequila bottles,  
casualties of man’s war against himself, dodge puddles of vomit,  
make my way to the beach just before sunrise, or just after sunset,  
to scrawl that day’s haiku in the sand for the sea to consume.  

Seventeen syllables to describe a life of loss and struggle,   
hardly adequate for most, but just enough for a true master  
and the double entendre of his reflection in the boardwalk lights  
as teenagers rush to buy their bottle rockets and M80s.  

I never ask for anything. Yet these tourists keep shoving coins  
into my hand and pockets, punctuated with words of encouragement  
that could have been lifted from any Hallmark card.  Is it guilt or pity  
that motivates them?  I want for nothing but my art.

## The Children of Never
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1. Day**

Their shadows move across the walls   
like silent whispers, following the sun  
into the basement of daylight.  I see   
their footprints in the dust behind  
the glowing monitors, tracking across  
the sandy emptiness of paper deserts,  
scaling the hills and mountains of computer parts  
strewn about the desk waiting for the earthquake  
to lift them up, give them new life. I hear their breathing  
in the hum of miniature fans, the glowing   
pulses of electricity moving through the circuits,  
calculations flipping pixel after pixel  
from one color to the next.  My hands on the keyboard  
cannot crowd them out with any combination of letters.  
Their black trumps my whites or blues or greys.  
I cannot erase them even with the light of day.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2. Night**

In the moonlight they start to bloom  
inside the picture frames of the departed  
sitting on the file cabinet behind me.  
My back always to them facing the future.  
The pull of the void forever draws me towards them.  
I hear the leathery voice of the young Cohen  
singing The Stranger Song, fingerpicking the nylon strings.  
I sift through the leafy words of Neruda and Lorca,  
or mine the crystals of Rilke and Trakl looking   
for that black pain which seeps through walls,  
an invisible smoke the alarms can’t detect.  
And they watch, silent as death, growing ever larger,  
feeding, dimming the electric light, twining themselves  
around the bookshelf, devouring words  
written ten days ago, a century, a millennium,  
and growing always growing until night disappears inside them.

## The Anywhapp Bird

I am the rarest bird of all,  
the bird with no feathers  
who flies through the clarity of shadows  
and the obscurity of sunlight  
on wings that can’t be seen.   
When I walk among the trees  
or search below the tombstones  
pecking the soil for little swords of seeds  
or umbrellas of grit to fill my beak  
all I can think about is flying  
into the unknown, that dark wound  
in the night questioning everything,
not knowing who might be waiting for me,  
who longs for my song or may be plotting my death.  
How will they know I’m coming  
when I don’t even know, how will they  
subdue me, tie me up, bleed me dry,  
cast my soul into the shrieking wind?  
I fly and fly on invisible wings,  
my song hidden safely inside my breast  
for no one to hear, and in the deafening quiet  
I watch the calm storm   
that is blowing furiously all around.  
I watch and watch until I have no choice.

## The Interrogation

We smile at each other in a frowning kind of way.  
I lean back in the wobbly wicker couch.  
He leans forward from the solid oak Jefferson chair.  
I can imagine him dead, ashen white,  
a fire that no longer even smolders,  
rogue to rub against my cheeks  
to mute the flames inside.  He speaks  
to ask me where I was last night, what color  
dress I was wearing, and all I can see are dead bees  
falling from his mouth onto the floor,  
a colony of servants sacrificed to kept the queen alive.  
My own words when they come  
feel like the steady cut of a Miyabi knife  
shaving razor thin slices of salmon colored flesh  
as I run my fingers over my pearls, slowly, hesitantly,  
offer another cup of tea, my brain exacting a coy  
precision from my lips.  Did you know the victim,  
so-and-so, he says, fingering a spiced almond wafer.  
I can envision the poison powdering his lips  
before he goes into convulsions,  
the butterfly wings of his heart frantically opening and closing.  
But he hesitates, reconsiders, thinks of his expanding waistline.  
Each word that leaves my mouth now emerges   
as a young girl in a perfectly ironed confirmation dress,   
a line of them holding hands walking toward church  
as they begin to rise heavenward.  
He seems momentarily satisfied,  
the silence between us like an iron curtain,  
a kind of détente either of us could break  
with an undiplomatic gesture or phrase.  
Still I feel him trying to stare through me   
like someone looking for ghosts in a haunted house.  
But he can only see the façade, the rafters, the plaster walls   
filled with family portraits going back centuries,  
not this gallery of the dead who whisper his name.  
I do not know how he will survive.

## Eating Whale as Spring Arrives at the Top of the World

This seems so illegal. But it isn’t.  
*Nalukatak*. The tribe is harvesting their yearly limit.  
The captain, fresh off the seal-skin boat,  
hoists the crew’s flag of triumph as a tractor  
drags the bowhead carcass across the sand  
and onto the wooden butchering platform.  
He climbs atop the great beast and cries  
*“Aarigaa!”* to the gathering crowd.  
Slabs of maktak fall to the curved knife,  
the delicacy of the eyeballs and flukes  
divvied out to the most honorable families.  
For days the village celebrates.  
What few stores exist are closed  
while the captain hands out *maktak*  
to all who stop by his house.  
Even *Pepe’s North of the Border*  
and the *Le Jardin Flower Shop*.  
My host grins back at me as he  
sets the plates on his modest table.  
The meat looks like dried dog turds,  
the blubber like slivers of lard.  
“This is our soul,” he says,  
“the soul of the people, how we stay together,  
keep from dying of loneliness and cold.”  
I close my eyes, and lift the first morsel  
to my lips, taste the salt, the plankton,  
the burn of the sea ice, and feel the polar bear  
always watching, always lurking,  
waiting for his opportunity to become a man.

## Like a Hermit

Today I walk across snowfields  
as though reading the book of my life written in braille.  

Each rise, each fall contains an avalanche of meaning,  
each crunch of boot against ice is an event that could shatter me.  

Twelve deer kneeling in the undergrowth  
are my disciples of solitude, the guardians of privacy.  

We live off the same land, gathering wild greens,  
peeling the bark off trees, sharing the mysteries of the dark.  

Each morning I rise with frost in my beard,  
my face slowly turning into a weathered fence post about to collapse.  

Miles of razor wire wrap around my body,  
all the wire for counties and counties. It is my burden to carry,  

my burden to bury inside myself with all the bodies of those I love  
to set their threadbare memories free  

as I heat a pot of dandelion tea in their honor.

## The Last (The War on History)

I’m the last Confederate soldier retreating on the road from Appomattox.  1865 was a long time ago, and the soles of my boots have worn down to my bare feet.  My coat is nibbled at by generation after generation of moths until it is threadbare.  Occasionally I use my Springfield as a crutch as I limp along the tree-lined roadway, building twig-fires at night, careful not to be seen by any scouting parties.  How many times have the leaves changed on me, the snow covered my private’s shoulders like epaulets?  And still I retreat, slashing through underbrush, crossing creeks, hopping fences, sleeping in ramshackled barns.  But the longer I walk the more I feel like I’m turning into a statue, my joints growing stiff, metallic, until at last, I become a resting place for birds, a fixture for the eyes of passersby to gaze upon or ignore, streaked by the oxidizing rain.  Then one day college students come to protest my presence, rock me back and forth on my pedestal, try to rip steel from granite, spray paint my uniform with slogans, splash me with red paint, try to erase the memory of myself and others walking through their history.  If only I could speak, I’d tell them if they look deeply enough in a mirror, they’ll see a strange reflection in their eyes – this man in a grey coat walking down a dusty road, blanket roll strapped over his shoulder, chewing on a piece of Indian grass, defeated as he heads toward home, that dilapidated farm house where they still hold the family reunions.

## Moonlight Sonata

It happens this way every night. Moonlight washes over the old man’s sleeping body until it begins to dissolve like a bar of soap. He can’t afford shades for the windows. He can’t afford much of anything other than food and a few clothes in his small three room house. But he lays perfectly still with threadbare sheets and blankets wrapping his body, the confining rectangle of the bed frame as his limbs begin to soften and sag, and his bones turn rubbery. He goes where the gravity of sleep pulls him, sliding down the bedpost like a large teardrop, puddling on the floor like water, flowing toward the doorway where there’s just enough space to squeeze through the bottom.  

In the humid night air of the field he becomes a vapor coalescing into a transparent cloud, a consciousness without a visible body that moves gingerly across each blade of grass examining its shaped, texture, the rough edges trimmed by the lawn mower. He holds out imaginary hands that are dark and filled with the fingerprints of stars. They touch the course bark of a willow, dip into the coolness of the farm pond, brush the new seedlings just beginning to sprout in the fields. Then they move on to the smooth clapboard of a house in dire need of painting, the wood-grain of an antique chair, a playpen he made once upon a time. Now he can see them through the cracked window pane, just two, mother and child, alone. They do not see him enter the room on the slight breeze blowing through the curtains. He stares at them for what seems like forever before he reaches out to stroke the warmth of a cheek and gaze into those deep green eyes for the last time, always the last time, before he disappears again.

## The Lost Pilot

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Poet James Tate has passed away at the age of 71.* 

I read that headline a couple of days ago browsing around the internet, but you’ve been gone for several years now, an unspecified lengthy illness. That face of the smart aleck tenager with the silly looking soul patch of hair below your bottom lip will never be seen again. How it sagged like a bowl of cold corn-mush over the years as your hair retreated in slow motion like an army searching for a trench to hide in.  I saw you once in Charlottesville many years ago. You and your buddy Simic were giving a reading.  You were the warm-up act, and he the featured lion tamer, cracking his whip for laughs.  The audience loved both of you.  Then, again, I saw you at the post-reading party.  While Simic worked the room like an insurance salesman, you stood off in the corner, alone, sipping your wine like a juvenile delinquent leaning against a red Camaro in a drug store parking waiting for the cool to happen.  But it never did that night.  And I stood on the other side of the room, alone among friends, occasionally watching, wanting to walk over and tell you how much I loved your work, even with my high-school level abilities at literary criticism.  But I didn’t.  I saw you as wounded too, just in a slightly different way, as your words and poems celebrated the public privacy of the absurd.  Now you are dead, and I feel like my own life is the residue of a stranger, someone at times I don’t even recognize.  Was it a mistake that placed us in this world?  Who knows. When I head out into the yard will I occasionally tilt my head toward the sky to see you passing through the cosmos like that tiny, African god in your seed pod of a spaceship that you mentioned in one of your poems-- silent, a canary who can no longer sing to make the bars of his cage disappear?  Or will I just focus on pulling weeds, tidying up the garden, lamenting the misfortune that placed these sorrow-filled worlds within us, embracing this escapism of being unable to fly?

## Elegiac Things

Windchimes on the deck barely  
stirred by the breeze, raindrops  
like little tuning forks striking  
sporadically with no sound,  
 
the dark diesel hum of thunderheads  
gathering on the horizon,  
the last strum of hummingbird wings  
splitting the air by the nectar feeder,   
 
the battles between different suitors  
vying for that final drink of sweetness  
before cool night sets in. You hear  
them all through the open window  
 
as you sit at the kitchen table  
sipping tea.  You hear them all  
like the grind of a giant wheel each day.  
Not even idle talk can make them go away.  
 
There’s the second hand on the clock  
clicking away the seconds, the grumbling belly  
of the fridge, the neighbors outside  
yelling at their kids to come in,  
 
the dog snoring on the couch,  
muffled barks in his sleep  
as he chases imaginary deer.  You feel it  
in your spine like a twinge of pain,  
 
a bulging disk that gets tweaked  
every time you make a sudden move,  
as if each day was a walk  
through a cemetery filled with faded dates  
 
and declarations of love receding into the past.  
The mechanical arm of the garbage truck  
rumbles as it empties last week’s refuse  
into the cave of waste and failure.  
 
This row of pictures reminds of what  
you’ve lost through death and neglect,  
the faces of those who may never return  
staring back at you from the mirror.

## October

Leaves tumble down around us  
curled up like lost souls, those who’ve departed  
to another world leaving a crispness behind in the air.  

Reds, browns and yellows suspended in flight,  
just brush strokes on an artist’s canvas  
as he paints us as two dark figures  

in the lower right strolling the edge  
of sanity beside a man-made pond   
as dried reeds chatter in the wind and geese call out   

overhead pushing their V’s southward.  He fails to see  
me take your hand, focused as he is  
on the flaming trees all around, the deer with one  

antler bending down for a cool drink.  He can’t detail  
the soft warmth of your fingers, your palm’s lifeline   
curved like a crescent moon before the harvest,  

or touch the golden fields of your hair, stare into  
your emerald eyes until he no longer knows  
where he is, no longer feels his hand holding the brush,  

dabbing it into the pigments on his palette. We’re now gone  
from his mind, just another detail captured on a moment’s whim,  
ephemeral, yet memorialized in blacks and browns.  

My heart wants to name you October,  
but my soul wants to keep you forever,  
our lives still this half-painted canvas we must finish together.

## January Pond

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  
Green of water plants in the shallows  
peeking through layers of ice,  
current circulating its life-blood  
of oxygen and plant debris  
past fish floating almost comatose   
in this winter dream-world  
trapped beneath a ceiling of silence.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  
Stones polished by the flow  
of the feeder creek,   
mouth open, the unfrozen part  
where the teeth reveal   
their uneven spacing,   
and the voice still sings   
its muffled song.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  
Willow limbs droop like fishing lines  
into the ice. Below the surface  
their buds bob like lures  
teasing summer.  You walk across  
the pond in snow boots,  
each fractured footprint  
a reminder, a warning.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  
Skaters draw their figure 8’s  
in the moonlight, imaging a double   
or triple lutz, the cheering crowds,  
their hand-me-down skates  
always a size too big or small,  
but their hearts still large enough  
to take in the whole world.

## Life in Black and White

A box of stills on the table, artifacts from the glacier  
of time, the snows of yesteryear slowly melting away.  
They are the tarot cards of your soul laid bare  
for all to see precisely where you came from,  
predict where your life is going, the characters  
whose fate will intertwine with yours like Escher  
tessellations evolving into an infinite future.  
First The High Priestess sitting in her rocking chair,  
her bullet-hole eyes staring wildly into the night,   
her tongue ready to cut out the heart of all  
who would dare question her.  Next The Fool  
in his diapers unrolling toilet paper in the bathroom,  
strutting around in a cowboy hat, six shooters  
strapped to his side, ready to gun down any  
bad guys who get in his way.  Then The Empress  
with her sunlike smile, her hand guiding   
her children through gardens filled with butterflies  
and hummingbirds, keeping them from straying  
into the tenements of bleakness.  The Magician   
leaps forward with his bag of alchemy, forever changing  
himself, moving from life to death and back again,  
employed then unemployed, in and out of bars,  
turning lead into gold, then gold into dirt.  
Lastly The Tower sits on its middle-class hill,  
lightning striking all around, fire reflected  
in its windows, the demons of madness and despair  
leaching up from the ground below, hidden,  
but forever lighting the corner of a blinking eye  
or lurking in the twitch of a crooked smile. Your past  
and your destiny are laid out before you,  
these photos from so long ago  
in black and white that you will guard with your life,  
when living was simpler, yet just as flawed.

## Dear Body,

heal thyself. Let the rituxan, bendamustine  
and velcade flow into your veins  
and do their jobs, peeling the cancer  
away like paint on an old weathered door.  
Watch those tumors disappear into nothing  
like the vision of an alternate reality.  
Become the temple again  
that you were meant to be.  
Renew the covenant with the mind  
to live forever in words and deeds.  
Lift the drug fog so I can concentrate again.  
Stop being this twisted bazaar of needles  
and bloodletting, this life weighed down  
by a history of ancient deeds.   
Stop being a garden weed that must be pulled  
because it chokes out the tap root of language.  
Be that flaming arrow you were destined to be  
when you left the womb on the island of Ithaca.  
Be the rebel yell charging with gun raised  
through the backwoods of Virginia  
as the enemy turns and runs. Be that hallowed ground  
bathed in moonlight where ghosts gather to tell their stories.  
Be that paper hive some fool lights on fire  
every now and again to watch  
words pour out and sting the world awake.

## Mr. Cam

Let’s pretend for moment there is a scrawny science teacher with yellow teeth who smokes a lot and likes to wave his arms around as he talks with a raspy voice about the current events of the day, who believes it is more important to teach his students how to think for themselves than to put them through the rigors of biology experiments, surgical dissections, cells under the microscope, squirming amebas in tap water, who constantly pokes and prods his nodding students for their opinions, challenges their positions until the bell saves them from the well-meaning onslaught.  

Imagine if you will this skinny little man in his black-rimmed glasses and bird nest hair who comes to work day after day to teach these snot-nosed adolescents how to think for themselves through the Socratic method, though he is supposed to be teaching science, goes home one Christmas holiday after quizzing the kids about the meaning of giving and charity and aid to the poor. Imagine he goes home for this extended break with his own family and decorates the tree, drinks spiked eggnog, exchanges presents with his loved ones and as the glow of the holiday begins to fade and the needles start to drop off the tree on to the floor he decides it is time to dispose of it, so after the bulbs and tinsel are removed and it is lifted from the stand he takes it over the fireplace and shoves the top into the crackling fire slowly pushing it into the fireplace as the needles pop and fizzle as they are sucked up the fireplace and out of house onto the roof where the fall leaves lay dry in gutters and begin to smolder, spark into flame, igniting the tar paper on the roof, the plywood, the roofing tiles, running down the walls to the drapes and carpeting.  

What are we, his students, to conclude using the Socratic method as his house burns to the ground and the car in the garage explodes, as he lapses into homelessness, with no food on the table, no bed to lay in and no way to get to work.  What are we to conclude from the science of fire, the chemical reaction between heat and organic matter, the mysteries of the mind? What is left to learn?  What more can he teach us?  This man relying upon the charity of others, with new shoes, a new wardrobe, a new car, a basement apartment to live in, who still lights matches for his pipe, who still burns wood, while his own logic lies in ashes on the front page of the newspaper, and who shows up for work each day to confront his students while playing the role of inquisitor, challenging everyone’s logic with the same joy of battle he had before.

## First Love

Dawn’s breathe crystalizes in the grass on either side of the street.  
My shadow strides forward twenty paces ahead of me  
with a confidence I never had.  No one’s out this time of morning,   
save a stray farm hand or two.  I hear one starting up the red  
Farmall tractor to head out to the tobacco fields where the leaves  
are being to brown with flavor.  He carries with him the smoke  
of last year’s harvest.  I can smell that and the gasoline fumes  
as he waves passing by, saying early for a teenager to be up  
and about.  I shrug and keep walking past the abandoned house  
with its centuries of history crawling up the walls like ivy.  
How many days did we play inside on the creaky floorboards,  
in rooms where babies were birthed and spanked, funeral vigils held,  
flowery weddings that ended in a celibate life of silence, and ghosts   
that chase each other down the corridors at night.  I cut across  
the meadow to get to the next road past the rusted cast iron fence  
encircling the family graveyard with its rain-faded markers  
and final resting places sinking like a feather bed under  
an unknown weight. I walk along the train tracks for several  
hundred yards before heading toward pavement again.  
In the distance I can see the Volunteer Fire Department  
with its rickety 1940’s fire engines and its people always asleep.  
In the field behind the building the unwashed carnies are still  
snoozing in their tents after a long night of cotton candy,   
fortune telling, ring tosses, merry-go-rounds and bumper cars.  
It was here last night when the unexpected happened,  
when the plainest of Becky’s took my hand at the top   
of the ferris wheel and the whole world began to spin like vertigo,   
my eyes going round and round, my body hot and sweaty   
against the cool night air.  What was this feeling I want to experience  
again and again, unpleasantly pleasant, awkward, speechless?  
My hand still has the imprint of that night burned into it,  
the lifeline growing stronger with each fragile memory.

## Sermon for the Fallen

I want to live in a place where they’ve never heard of death,   
where everyone walks around in blissful ignorance  
that their life is going to end one day, where pain and loss  
are not thoughts people dwell on as they go about  
their daily lives. I see the barber and the antique dealer  
on Main St. sunning themselves in chairs as they wait  
for customers to show, and little children with backpacks  
skipping home from school into the arms of their families.  
I see the hill where a funeral home would normally be  
remains pasture land with horses grazing on the stubble,  
and city hall has no window that says “Register of Wills.”  
Yet on the horizon there are clouds gathering, flashes  
of lightning, trees whipsawed by the wind, driving rain  
heading towards us, but it always takes a left or right turn,  
always skirts around the edges of our little town like  
a fiery sermon that never gets delivered from God’s pulpit.  
No one asks who’s missing from the normal breakfast  
at the diner.  There’s no sense of absence in our lives,  
that vacancy that can’t be filled by a thousand prayers.  
There’s just the certainty that today will be exactly   
like yesterday.  The same people will walk by, knock  
on our doors, call on the phone, meet us on the playground  
or at the drive-in, and we will love them the way we always   
have, their spirits with us forever in mind and body,  
not just negatives on camera film, or voices and shadows  
in home movies, but in front of us to touch and hug each day.

## Mercy

To be merciful  
said the old woman  
is to live with head raised,  
to peer out across the roads and fields  
for the weak and downtrodden,  
to bring them home and nurse  
them back to health  
until they rise up out of the ashes  
in the process of being reborn.  

To be merciful  
said the yellow tulip  
is to poke my head  
out of the ground when the days  
begin to turn warm, when the snow  
melts into the first shadows of leaves  
and as winter-weary people walk by  
shine brightly like my own little sun  
burning a smile into somebody’s miserable day.  

To be merciful  
said the dog  
is to place my head in the lap  
of my owner when he is sad,  
to lift him out of his sorrow  
and get him to focus on other things,  
to walk the halls of the hospital on a leash  
as therapy for the cancer patients with their IVs,  
to take their minds off death for a moment.

## The Mystery of Faith
 
Envelopes arrive filled with the ashes of Notre-Dame Cathedral.  Each day a new one, postmarked from different arrondissements. I empty the soot and cinders onto my desk here in America, shape the mound into a cross, a kind of holy ground where my soul can kneel in peace. Who is this mystery sender, an ocean and a language away? Am I just a cruel joke to them, or is this an act of mercy? Night brings the sound of flames, the rush of air and heat through my brain’s rafters, a steeple that collapses in on itself. Yet just before sunrise I see the altar’s gold gleaming through the smoke, a wine-filled chalice unharmed, the Virgin framed in rays of gilded light through which my bride steps to lift me up from the catacombs of sleep, place me on the streets of Paris in front of a mailbox holding an envelope, making the sign of the cross before I open the door.

## Bricklayer

I once watched a man lay bricks  
kneeling and standing on a scaffold  
with a trowel shaped like an old metal iron  
before the invention of electricity.  He dipped  it  
over and over into a tub of cement  
placed beside him to pull out globs  
that he’d fling on top of the brick he’d set   
a few minutes earlier before slowly grinding  
the next brick into place, scraping off the excess  
cement to fling it on his next target.   
When he ran low, his partner would pick  
up two stacks of four from the bundle  
on the ground and toss them gracefully  
upward as the bricklayer’s thick hands  
caught the batch whole as skilled  
as any professional football receiver and placed them  
on the wooden planks in a neat pile for the next  
rows as the wall grew in height.  Hour after hour,  
day after day they labored in this symmetrical rhythm  
until the façade butted up against the roof line  
and the final gaps were filled with their absence.

## (In)Seine

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*for Paul Celan*

He drowned himself nearly fifty years ago  
over love.  A different kind of love.  
Of self, and language.  The god of words,  
vengeful, spiteful, filled us with illusions.   
Our quarrel began that day and continues  
like a one-sided marathon, him talking backwards  
through time, me talking forwards, tripping, stammering  
over every stone, lost in the black forest  
of his thoughts.  His wound’s mark in the air,  
I always found myself standing in its shadow,  
knee-deep in ferns, smelling the damp, fertile rot  
of the forest floor as I poured the urnful of dust   
collected since he departed into his memory.  
We were like brothers in love with the same girl,  
blonde curly hair, absinthe-tinted eyes, with umlaut-dimples  
on her cheeks.  She was that goal we could never obtain.  
We both failed miserably in our own disagreeable ways  
as we broke the living room furniture   
with our verbal gymnastics.  Moonshadows   
possessed him, together with star-swifts  
darting through the night sky.  I find myself always   
writing in a strange voice, clutching icicles   
plucked from his brow as if they were pens.

## Waiting for an Elevator at the University of Maryland Medical Center

Guess my illness and I’ll guess yours,  
I want to say to the crowd gathering  
around the 9th floor bank of elevators.  
Who here is contagious, please raise your hand  
and take the next car down.  But I don’t   
have the energy or the poor taste.  
All I see around me are the tired, sad eyes  
of the sick, many in wheelchairs, and their caregivers,  
haggard and grey.  My own drug-exhausted eyes  
have lost their focus on everything  
but the bacteria and viruses swirling invisibly  
around us, circulated through air vents,   
expelled by a cough or sneeze,  
multiplying on any surface that is touched.  I want to say  
friends, just hang in there; we’ll get through   
this together.  But a coincidence of timing places   
strangers beside each other, looking for ways of escape.  
Soon we’ll all be losing our hair, turning pale   
as zombies, the bone marrow and antibodies   
in our blood destroyed by chemo drugs,   
only to be rebuilt later with harvested stem cells.  
Two elevators ding almost simultaneously  
and we file into the closest to begin our descent  
into reality as the living dead.  My wife is my rock.  
She guides my wheelchair out of the hospital  
toward the parking garage as we head  
across an intersection, pass junkies  
in the park just starting to get their daily jitters  
and street vendors hawking gaudy wares.  
Next we walk through churchyard shadows where Poe  
sleeps calmly in his grave, unable to even imagine  
these modern-day technological tortures.  
But we still believe in miracles.  We see them   
in front of us every day.  It’s what keeps us coming back.

## Life’s Calendar

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*after Dan Cuddy*

The days go up in smoke,  
little pieces of my life  
constantly flaking off   
to stoke the fires that keep   
my world warm, vibrant.  

These ashes don’t diminish me.  
They are a mound   
upon which I grow   
into some shrinking phoenix  
forever struggling to take wing.  

I creak and groan,  
an abandoned house  
in wind and rain,  
waiting for ghost-hunters to enter   
searching for their treasures.  

But no one comes,  
so I sift through books   
under lamp light,  
replay the keystrokes of history,  
follow the Escher curve of words  

backwards and forwards  
over the scree and cinders  
of human foibles.  
No one comes so I eat take out   
from below average restaurants  

wondering why everything  
tastes the same, yet so different,  
like a dictionary of word noodles   
arranged in infinite combinations   
to give meaning to meaninglessness.  

Yet sometimes deep in the night   
I can feel my body take this nourishment    
of ashes, compost, and mold it into feathers  
to glide through the air of time,   
if only my mind believes it is possible,  

if only my wings would respond.

## The Taxi Driver

The customer insisted on talking a short-cut  
as he chatted away on his cell phone:  
f- this, f- that, here's what I'm going to do  
to you when I get home..... The language  
was too full of raging hormones  
to be his wife on the other end.  
I couldn't help but watch this old man  
in the mirror with his white hair  
streaming from under a blue ball cap,  
the glasses thick with extreme near-sightedness,   
the wicked snarl on his moist lips. Turn here,  
he said, as a possum's eyes scurried   
past the headlights, then later a buck  
stood in the road before us refusing to move.  
Just nudge the b- a touch with the car bumper,  
and he'll run away like the sissy he is,  
the man said as he continue to look  
at pictures on his cell phone.  Later,  
he had me pull over so he could go  
and I watched his diminutive figure submerge  
into the woods. Thirty minutes later I went looking  
only to find him face-down and pants-down   
in a raspberry bush, minute cuts on a wrinkled face   
now without glasses.  Screw it, he said,  
and we headed back down the road.  
I could see him staring at me   
through the rear view mirror as he pulled  
some caramel popcorn out of his jacket,  
made no offer to share.  He was strange like that.  
We drove through miles of farmland   
with rock fences lining the road,  
hours without a word, the silence heavy  
as a unexpected gunshot in the night.  
Around dawn we hit the outskirts of a town.  
I heard a sigh of relief as we passed a junior high  
and turned the corner into a neighborhood of row homes.  
Eight hours after I'd picked him up at the airport,  
thinking here's an easy fair, this old man  
with nothing but a black binder under his arm,  
said here, stop here, in front of a house painted  
in the brightest Caribbean colors.  As I flipped   
the meter off and turned to quote the price,  
he flung the door open and fled between houses,  
a single sheet of paper left behind,  
the message written in cursive: IOU in the next life.
